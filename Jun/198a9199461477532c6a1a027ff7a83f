The University of Ibadan (UI) has confirmed that Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki graduated from the institution. In a statement by its Registrar, Mrs Olubunmi Faluyi, the university said Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki, gained admission to the university in 1976 and graduated in 1979 with a Second Class Honours (Lower Division). “Records of his admission and graduation are intact in the archives of the university.” the statement said. Obaseki has been at loggerhead with his predecessor and erstwhile godfather, Adams Oshiomhole, the Chairman of All Progressive Congress (APC), who recently accused him of presenting a fake degree certificate. Oshiomhole who had questioned the genuineness of Obaseki’s UI certificate, directed the APC screening committee to confirm if it indeed issued from the nation’s premier university “Someone should approach the UI and end this matter once and for all. If the certificate Obaseki parades is that of the UI, find out how did he pass senate screening of those days? I’m aware that in those days when this man never dreamt of becoming a governor, every student, no matter your status or your family name, must pass the screening, he had said.
