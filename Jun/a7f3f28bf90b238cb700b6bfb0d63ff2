Dr. Jennifer Blanke, the Vice President of Agriculture, Human and Social Development at the African Development Bank, has resigned her position. Her resignation will take effect from July 4, 2020. The bank made this announcement in a statement shared via its official twitter handle on Wednesday. The AfDB has been enmeshed in controversy lately, with its president, Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina of Nigeria facing allegations of corruption. However, Blanke, who joined the bank in early 2017, has made it clear that her resignation from the has nothing to do with the ongoing storm at the bank. Rather, she explained that she was leaving for family reasons because she needed to rejoin her family in Switzerland, “after a very fulfilling time at the bank.” She said, “I thank President Akinwumi Adesina for his strong leadership, guidance, and support which have undoubtedly motivated and helped my team and I to play a key role in the transformation of the bank.  I feel privileged to have been given an opportunity to contribute to the bank’s agenda for accelerating Africa’s social and economic transformation.” Adesina on his part said he was delighted to have worked with Blanke for over three years. “She has demonstrated genuine leadership skills and moved the needles on so many fronts, especially in the areas of food security, women’s financial empowerment, and job creations. I wish her all the best and look forward to continued partnerships and engagement with Jennifer,” he said.
