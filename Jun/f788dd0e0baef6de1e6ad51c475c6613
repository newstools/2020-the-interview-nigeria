The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Ministerial Enforcement Task Force on COVID-19 Restrictions has sealed off the Jabi Lake Mall indefinitely for violating the government’s directive on ban on public gathering. The FCTA in a tweet via its official twitter handle on Sunday, announced that the Jabi Lake Mall had been sealed off for breaching Presidential Task Force’s directives on the ban on public gatherings. “The FCT Ministerial Task Team on #COVID19 seals up Jabi Lake Mall indefinitely for violating Presidential Task Force’s directives on the ban on public gatherings as part of measures to contain the spread of the dreaded pandemic in the territory.” Though the FCTA did not state reasons for sealing Jabi Lake Mall, the development is said to be connected to a concert held at Jabi Lake on Saturday in which Azeez Fashola, alias <strong>Naira Marley and his crew members performed. Naira Marley was reported to have flown into Abuja in a private jet alongside his crew to perform at the concert organised by Network Africa and Traffic Bar at the Jabi Lake Mall on Saturday, thereby breaching the COVID-19 ban on public gatherings put in place by the federal government. Ibidun Ighodalo, a former Nigerian beauty queen and wife of Pastor Ituah Ighodalo of The Trinity Church, is dead. Reports say that she died of cardiac arrest on Sunday morning, in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. “She apparently slumped. She was trying to set up isolation centres,” a source said. Mrs. Ighodalo, who is the founder of an events company, Elizabeth R and Ibidun Ighodalo Foundation, got married to Pastor Ituah Ighodalo of The Trinity Church about 13 years ago after he separated from his first wife. Ibidun was 39 years old at the time of her death and is survived by her husband, Pastor Ituah Ighodalo and two children.
