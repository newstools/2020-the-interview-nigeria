The Senate on Thursday confirmed Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem as the President of the Court of Appeal. This was two days after President Muhammadu Buhari forwarded her name to the upper legislative assembly. Before then there was widespread speculation that the government was reluctant to forward her name for confirmation as President of the Court of Appeal and was instead in favour of a different candidate. Umar Dangiwa, retired colonel and former military administrator of Kaduna State, had also in an open letter accused President Buhari of delaying Dongban-Mensemâ€™s confirmation as the substantive head of the appellate court. The President of the Court of Appeal had appeared before the Senate for screening a day earlier after the President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawan sent her name to the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters. The committee led by its Chairman, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele cleared almost instantly and advised the Senate to confirm her nomination.
