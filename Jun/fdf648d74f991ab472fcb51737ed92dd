The Federal Government has declared Friday, June 12, 2020 as public holiday to mark this year’s Democracy Day Celebration. The Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Adesoji Aregbesola who made the declaration on behalf of the Federal Government on Monday in a statement, congratulated all Nigerians at home and abroad for the entrenchment of democratic rule in the country. He commended the heroes of democracy for their dogged determination and sacrifice which eventually birthed Democratic Governance in Nigeria. Aregbesola called on all Nigerians to continue to cherish these selfless efforts and collaborate with the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Administration to ensure the realization of the democratic ideals which the Patriots fought for even at the cost of their lives. The minister also reassured Nigerians of the Federal Government’s commitment to battle the scourge of COVID-19 with the cooperation of all citizens, urging Nigerians to stay safe by observing physical and social distancing, personal and respiratory hygiene, as well as other regulations issued by relevant authorities. The Muhammadu Buhari government had in 2018 declared June 12 Nigeria’s new Democracy Day in honour of late Moshood Abiola, the widely acclaimed winner of the annulled June 12, 1993 presidential election. Abiola, who died in detention in 1998, was also conferred with a posthumous honourary GCFR title.
