Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, has provision a score of the commission’s activities saying assets of N980bn have been recovered and in the last years, secured 2,240 criminal convictions. Magu was speaking on Thursday in a media briefing as part of activities to mark the 2020 Democracy Day in Abuja, which as from this year is on June 12, in honour of late politician MKO Abiola. Some of the assets recovered by the commission according to Magu, include estates, private jets and oil vessels. He said, “As you all know in your regular reporting, the EFCC is not only ahead, it is clearly so. We are on course in all the cases we are prosecuting. Our scorecard in the area of conviction is 2,240 in the last five years. “We have recovered assets in excess of N980bn and quite a large array of non-monetary assets like properties, estates, private jets, oil vessels, filling stations, schools, hotels, trucks and other automobiles, jewelleries, plazas, shopping malls, electronics, among others. Magu said, “The EFCC takes both enforcement and prevention strategies very seriously. Our enforcement is not about tough talks, it is about tough actions. It is not about rhetoric, it is about professionalism. It is not about seminars, it is about criminals and how to bring them to book.” He stated that the EFCC was making impressive progress in digitalised and non-digitalised investigations. He said, “All our cases are being pursued with vigour and alacrity. This is why we have results across all our zones. The EFCC is committed to our democratic project as a nation. “The anti-corruption agenda of President Muhammadu Buhari is real, robust and yielding visible results. We will not relent on our assigned mandate. As I always emphasise, public ownership of the anti-corruption war is one of the best showcase of our patriotism.”
