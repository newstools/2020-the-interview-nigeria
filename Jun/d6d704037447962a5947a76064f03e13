President Buhari has sent the nomination of Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem, Acting President, Court of Appeal, to the Senate for confirmation as President, Court of Appeal. President Buhari disclosed this on Monday via his twitter handle. He said, “I have sent the nomination of Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem, Acting President, Court of Appeal, to the Senate for confirmation as President, Court of Appeal, in line with the recommendation of the National Judicial Council.” The president’s nomination is coming nine days after Umar Dangiwa, retired colonel and former military administrator of Kaduna State, in an open letter accused President Buhari of delaying Dongban-Mensem’s confirmation as the substantive head of the appellate court. Dongban-Mensam’s confirmation has been surrounded with much controversy after her first three months acting tenure expired and the president rather than confirming her reappointed her in an acting capacity. This is despite the fact that the National Judicial Council had recommended that she be confirmed as the substantive court of appeal president.
