The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Adamawa State on Wednesday said it would remove the names of its members who accept the political appointments from the Fintiri-led government. It could be recalled that the state governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri had last week announced the appointment of some top politicians as his political aides including APC members. But the party in a statement signed by its publicity secretary, Mohammed Abdullahi, said accepting the appointment automatically disqualified them from being members of the party according to Article 9.5 of the party’s constitution. “We refer to the recent appointments released by the PDP Government in the State that featured the names of some members of our Great Party and wish to draw the attention of the appointees to Article 9.5 of the APC Constitution which states that, any Party Member that accepts a political appointment from any political party or opposition Government ceases to be a member of APC. “While we commend the loyalty and faithfulness of our Party members who rejected the appointments offered to them by the PDP Government, all those who accept the appointments will have their names removed from the Party Register,” the statement reads. The party accused the PDP of trying to cause commotion and disunity within the APC family in the state and assured its members that the ruling party will not succeed. “In conclusion, the APC is keenly watching the PDP government s fruitless efforts in trying to cause commotion and disunity within the APC family. This attempt has failed and will ever fail. It therefore urges our members to remain resolute and focused on supporting the Buhari Administration as we further unite to take over power in Adamawa State in 2023.”
