The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons on Sunday published the names and photos of convicted sex offenders and rapists. The names and photos addresses of those who were convicted for rape were published via the agency’s Twitter handle on Sunday. The Director General of the agency, Julie Okah-Donli, said NAPTIP is determined to keep publishing the names and details of sex offenders and rapists to name and shame them for their nefarious acts. She said, “Here are the identities of convicted sex offenders as seen on the Nigeria Sex Offender Register. @naptipnigeria Is determined to naming and shaming all sex offenders.” She assured Nigerians that more names will be published as convictions keep coming in. “More names will be published as the convictions keep coming in. #saynotorape #endrape #sexoffenderregister”, she said. According to the sex offenders register published by the agency on Sunday, six offenders were convicted in 2019 while four others have been convicted in 2020. The register also showed that the offenders were from Ekiti, Abuja, Kano, and Lagos states. Among those in the published list is a former school supervisor at Chrisland School, Lagos; 47-year-old Adegboyega Adenekan, who was jailed 60 years for defiling a two-year-old pupil in the school. Increasing rape cases in Nigeria has elicited intensified advocacy against rape and also calls for more stringent punishment for rapists in Nigeria.
