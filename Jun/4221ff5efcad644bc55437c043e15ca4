However, a summary of the revised budget, tagged; Budget of Prosperity, seen by The Interview showed that sanitation and janitorial services of the Government House alone would gulp the sum of N400m in 2020. The same Government House where Governor Yahaya Bello currently operates from will also gulp another N200m for remodeling, according to the revised budget. Further checks by The Interview showed that the Government House got more funding than all the other ministries in the state in the revised 2020 budget. It was allocated N17, 787,235,011, the highest for a single component in the budget. The Education Ministry got  N17,520,530,646, the Health Ministry got N11,914,360,693 and Agriculture Ministry got N4,114,075,832. When compared with what other sectors were allocated, the Kogi State Government House got over N260m more than the Education Ministry, over N5bn more than the Health Ministry and over 13bn more than the Agriculture Ministry. With Kogi State’s annual Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) estimated to be N13.4bn in the revised budget summary, the Government House will spend over N17bn, which is N4bn more than the state’s annual IGR. All efforts The Interview made on Wednesday to speak with the state’s commissioner of finance, budget and planning, Asiwaju Asiru Idris, failed as he did not pick calls and also didn’t respond to text message and WhatsApp messages seeking clarification on the revised budget.

The former governor, however, added that he later found that as he was approaching age 70 and life was becoming more comfortable. He said, “I used to tell God that once I clock 70, it is enough. My dad died two months to his 70th birthday. So I unusually say if I can clock 70 on earth like my dad it is enough. “But you see when I am now close to 70 and I am enjoying life, I am telling God that clocking 70 is small, it is not enough.” Ajimobi was rumoured dead last week but it later emerged that he was in intensive care at the First Cardiology Hospital, Lagos, where he reportedly died on Thursday afternoon. While in hospital, he was named the acting national chairman of the All Progressive Congress (APC).
