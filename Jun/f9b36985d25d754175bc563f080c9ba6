The Bureau of the Board of Governors of the Africa Development Bank (AfDB) has authorised the independent investigation of its president, Akinwumi Adesina. Adesina, a former agriculture minister in Nigeria is up for reelection but is fighting allegations of impropriety from a whistle blower report. However, after an earlier probe that was carried out internally cleared him of all charges, the United States (US) government, a major shareholder in AfDB called for an independent investigation. The Bureau of the Board of Governors in a communique signed by its Chairperson, Niale Kaba on June 4, reiterated “that it agrees that the Ethics Committee of the Boards of Directors performed its role on this matter in accordance with the applicable rule under Resolution B/BG/2008/11 of the Board of Governors.” The communique read, “The Bureau also reiterates that the Chairperson of the Bureau of the Board of Governors performed her role in accepting the findings of the Ethics Committee in accordance with the said Resolution. “However, based on the views of some Governors on the matter and the need to carry every Governor along in resolving it, the Bureau agrees to authorise an Independent Review of the Report of the Ethics Committee of the Boards of Directors relative to the allegations considered by the Ethics Committee and the submissions made by the President of the Bank Group thereto in the interest of due process. Kaba said the Independent Review would be conducted by a neutral high calibre individual with unquestionable experience, high international reputation and integrity within a short time period of not more than two to four weeks maximum, taking the Bank’s electoral calendar into account. She said the Bureau agreed that within a three to six month period and following the independent review of the Ethics Committee Report, an independent comprehensive review of the implementation of the Bank Group’s Whistle-Blowing and Complaints Handling Policy should be conducted with a view to ensuring that the Policy is properly implemented, and revising it where necessary, to avoid situations of this nature in the future.
