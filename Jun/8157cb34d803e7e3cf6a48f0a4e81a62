The local government chairmen of Takum, Ussa, Kurmi and Sardauna have imposed total lockdown to tighten their border communities with Cameroon. Local sources say that the security operatives are working with the local government chairmen to seal off entry points along the Cameroon border. In compliance with the order, the Chairman of Takum local government council, Honourable Shiban Tikari has been working on ways to checkmate the influx of Cameroonians as well as ensuring residents of the border communities are properly sensitised on the scourge of COVID-19. Shiban alongside security chiefs, PMO Takum specialist hospital and a team of medical personnel drawn from 93 Battalion Barracks embarked on lockdown assessment round the entry points of the town, not only to ensure enforcement but provide sensitization campaigns to residents. Shiban said the most porous  entry points among the border communities with Cameroon includes  Jatou-Akongo, Alan, Manga, Shibong, Liji and Lutu Nigeria and Lutu Cameroon where there are reports of influx due to border porosity. However, to achieve the desired results, the residents were sensitised while security operatives were deployed in strategic entry points to checkmate further infiltration. Like in the border communitiesâ€™ security operatives also mounted surveillance checkpoints in Ibi, Wukari, Mayo-lope, Zing, and Takum-Katsina/Ala entry points. Our correspondent observed that there were some precautionary measures to tighten Taraba boundaries with Benue State as the provision of needed sensitisation campaign, starting from River Ron through Kashimbila, Jatou-Aka, Dogongawa, Kasuwan Haske through Vongiri and Chanchanji respectively.
