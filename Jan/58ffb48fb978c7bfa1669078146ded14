The Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, on Wednesday disassociated himself from his colleagues who’re calling for Adams Oshiomhole to quit as All Progressive Congress national chairman. Sule who made this known during an interview on ChannelsTV’s Politics Today on Wednesday, said he believed in the rule of law and that those who want the party Chairman changed should go through due process. When asked if he was one the governors calling Oshiomhole to quit as the party national chairman, Mr. Sule said he was not one of the governors. He said, “I am not of those calling for Oshiomhole to quit as party chairman.” The governor stressed that if a chairman was to be changed it should follow due process and not create rancour within the party. He stated, “when a party leader is to be changed, I think there must be issues that calls for him to be changed. “And as far I am concerned people should follow things properly and not create too much tension within the party, create problems where there are none. That is what I believe.”
