The Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, has declared the regional security outfit recently launched by six states of the southwest region of the country has illegal. In a statement released by his office, Malami said state governments lacked the legal powers to set up any organisation in the name of tackling security, as it was constitutionally on the exclusive list and can only be taken up by the federal government. He also threatened the prosecution of anyone involved with Amotekun saying, “The law will take its natural course in relation to excesses associated with organisation, administration and participation in “Amotekun” or continuous association with it as an association. The statement signed by Dr. Umar Gwandu, special assistant on media to the AGF reads, “No state government, whether singly or in a group has the legal right and competence to establish any form of organization or agency for the defense of Nigeria or any of its constituent parts. “This is sanctioned by the provision by the provision of Item 45 of the Second Schedule of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) authorizing the Police and other Federal Government security services established by law to maintain law and order.” The statement added, “The setting up of the paramilitary organization called “Amotekun” is illegal and runs contrary to the provisions of the Nigerian law. The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) has established the Army, Navy and Air force including the Police and other numerous organisations for the purpose of the defence of Nigeria”.
