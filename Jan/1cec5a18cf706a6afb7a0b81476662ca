A former senator, Shehu Sani, said his detention by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over the $24,000 bribery allegation levelled against him, is a ploy to damage his image and gag him. Sani has been in the commission’s custody for alleged extortion of $24,000 from the Chairman of ASD Motors, Alhaji Sani Dauda since December 31, 2019. The former senator who represented Kaduna Central Senatorial district in the eight assembly reportedly spoke to Daily Trust via WhatsApp on Friday. He said the allegation was baseless and unfounded, and that Alhaji Sani Dauda is a state agent sponsored by to tarnish his reputation and mute him and he would not be silenced. “It is a scripted stream of mischievous concoctions and utter fabrications using a puppet state agent; all aimed at splashing mud on me. The extortion allegation is nothing but a wholesale falsehood, packaged in a phantom anti-graft facade to taint, stain and mute me. That shall never happen if I am alive,” he stated. Condemning his detention which he described as unfair and politically motivated, Sani said he has demanded that the EFCC make public the statement of his accuser and his for the world to see. He said, “I have made my statement and provided all my facts against their package of lies and I demand the EFCC to make public all the sheets of our statements and supporting documents for the world to see. My detention is unfair, unjust, prearranged and politically motivated. ”Alhaji Sani Dauda and his hidden sponsors have not been able to provide any proof of their allegations. I’m unjustly incarcerated on the ground of an arranged two page petition backed with no evidential or documentary proof.”
