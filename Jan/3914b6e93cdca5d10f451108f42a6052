President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday explained the planned withdrawal of the military from some areas hitherto affected by insurgency and other forms of insecurity. President Buhari, who spoke via twitter said it would allow the military focus on defending the country against external aggression, while the Police and officers of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) manage internal security of the country. He said, “The withdrawal is to allow the military focus on its primary duty of defending the nation against external aggression. It is the duty of the police to handle internal security since Nigeria is not at war. “The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps will support the police to provide internal security.” President Buhari added that there was no cause for alarm because the exercise is well planned and will not jeopardise the success recorded by the military. He said, “Let me reassure Nigerians that the planned withdrawal of the military from areas where peace has been restored will be gradual and carefully planned. “It will not be abrupt or arbitrary; will not be carried out in a manner that will expose communities to greater risk of attacks. “There is therefore no cause for alarm, regarding the planned withdrawal. We will not do anything to jeopardise the successes already recorded by the military. We will not expose any part of Nigeria to harm or danger.”
