President Muhammadu Buhari has disclosed the federal government’s plan to engage more qualified teachers in order to increase the teacher-to-pupil ratio in the country. According to Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President on Media and publicity, Buhari spoke on Tuesday while receiving the leadership of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), in Abuja. He said, “We have created a dedicated platform under the National Social Investment Programme called N-Power Teach, which engages qualified graduates to man the gaps of basic education delivery in Nigeria. ‘‘These N-Power Teach Volunteers are deployed as teacher assistants in primary schools across Nigeria to support existing teachers. ‘‘The aim of this, and many other Government programmes, is to increase the teacher-student ratio at the primary school level thereby enhancing the quality of students moving to secondary schools. ‘‘I want to take this opportunity to ask all members of Nigeria Union of Teachers to support these programmes and encourage as many qualified and willing graduates to enrol in the teaching profession,’’ the President said. Describing the teaching profession as one of the noblest of professions, President Buhari told the delegation led by the union’s National President, Comrade Nasir Idris, that: ‘‘It shapes the character, calibre and future of individuals and nations. You and I were all taught by teachers who molded our persons and influenced our future. No price is too high for good rewards.’’ The President also used the occasion to pay tribute to teachers, noting that they had been at the forefront of cultivating young minds to be innovative and inventive. ‘‘Today, we live in a dynamic world where science and technology drives innovations that virtually touch every aspect of our lives.
