A former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, has told the members of the People’s Democratic Party to not be preoccupied with elections at the moment but rather focus on rebuilding the party. Atiku, who was the PDP’s presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections, said in a tweet on Saturday, that rebuilding the party was more important at this time. The former vice president, one of the founding members of the party, said the PDP should be focused on how to rebuild and strengthen the party for the challenge ahead and not dwell on elections. Atiku said, “Our preoccupation at this point in the @OfficialPDPNig should not focus on elections, but on rebuilding and strengthening our party for the challenges ahead of us.” The PDP lost power at the centre to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), in 2015 and also failed to win the 2019 presidential election.
