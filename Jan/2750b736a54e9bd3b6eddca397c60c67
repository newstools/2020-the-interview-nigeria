The Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communication Commission, Prof Umar Danbatta has set up several platforms to manage how consumer complaints are managed by the major telecommunication company, particularly as it relates to financial fraud. The commission touted this as one of several successes in an internal review of its activities in 2019. Stepping up measures with respect of consumer complaints resolution was one initiative the Commission reportedly took very seriously in 2019. The Interview learnt that the commission has revised its Consumer Complaints & Service Level Agreement (CC/SLA) to improve consumer complaint management and resolution in a more promptly manner by the service providers. In an effort to address consumer issues, NCC, in the course of 2019, also inaugurated a multi-sectoral committee to combat the issue of financial frauds using telecoms or digital platforms. Similarly, the NCCâ€™s Open Forum of the Industry Consumer Advisory Forum (ICAF) for the fourth quarter of 2019, was targeted at addressing areas of protection for the consumers with respect to financial frauds committed by criminals using telecoms platforms.
