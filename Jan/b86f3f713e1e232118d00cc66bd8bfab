The presidency on Wednesday said Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, who called for the resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari should be in jail. During plenary on the Senate floor,  Abaribe, who stood as surety for the leader of proscribed Independent People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, had said the president should resign for failing to secure the country. However, in a statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the presidency said Abaribe should be in jail by now for failing to produce Nnamdi Kanu for prosecution. The statement reads: “President Buhari to resign on what basis? Just because some characters think that President Buhari should resign, then they expect him to quit. “That call does not represent the opinion of the country. This is the opinion of an arm chair critic, known for making stray comments. “If a leader like President Buhari needs to resign, there are millions of other Nigerians who need to resign, including Senator Abaribe who unlocked the door to enable the escape of traitorous and treasonable suspects. “He signed the bond for the court to release Nnamdi Kanu on bail, from which moment the suspect disappeared into the thin air. Senator Abaribe has failed repeated deadlines to return Kanu to the court for trial, yet he has the effrontery with which to accuse someone of failing to the bidding of the law. “This is a man who should have replaced the suspects he failed to produce in the correctional facility. “Abaribe’s party raped the nation and left it collapsing in 2015 and President Buhari is fixing things up all the years he is in office.
