Professor Kingsley Moghalu, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, says there will be more poverty and unemployment in the 2020. Moghalu, who was Young Progressive Party presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections, stated this in an exclusive New Year interview with The Interview. When asked what his economic projections for the new year were, Moghalu said he wished he could be positive but could shy away from the economic realities he was seeing. He said, “I see more poverty and unemployment in the horizon… I wish I could be more positive, but I am simply facing the economic realities I see. Moghalu noted that his prediction was based on facts and regardless of who is in charge of the government. He said, “I would say the same thing based on the same set of facts regardless of who is in charge of the government”.
