The federal government has said that Transparency International’s ranking is a perception and nothing more than a distorted view of reality considering that no effort is made to track financial flows and money laundering. The chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against  Corruption, Prof. Itse Sagay, who spoke with The Interview on the ranking released earlier today said TI is missing the picture and should not be in the business at all if they cannot gather statistics on the work done by agencies like EFCC and ICPC in curbing corruption and money laundering. He said, “And that is what this government is doing, removing the influence of money from our elections and removing impunity. TI themselves admit that the report is a perception on corruption in every nation, not reality.” Transparency International, he said is engaging in slander and should be disregarded. The EFCC, he said, “has recorded over 2000 convictions including governors. They have recovered close to a N1trillion in assets.” The 2019 report focuses and analyzes how corruption impacts political integrity suggesting corruption is more pervasive in countries where big money can flow freely into electoral campaigns and where governments listen only to voices of wealthy or well-connected individuals.
