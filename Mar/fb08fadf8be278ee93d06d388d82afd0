The Coronavirus and plunge in oil price is already taking a toll on the Naira, as the Nigerian currency fell in value against the US dollar. This is just as economists are warning that the panic buying in the parallel market could lead to a total collapse of the Naira, which could itself trigger a rise in interest rates and a possible economic recession by the middle of the year. The value of the naira on Thursday continued to fluctuate as bureau de change operators in Abuja exchanged every $1 for N385, but a little less than the N390 it sold for on Wednesday. With the price of oil continuously falling for the last few days, Brent Crude is now priced at $33.35 in the international market. Oil accounts for 70 per cent of Nigeria’s foreign exchange earnings.
