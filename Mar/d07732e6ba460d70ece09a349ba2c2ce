Chikwe Ihekweazu, director-general of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), has been quarantined for 14 days. Osagie Ehanire, minister of health, disclosed this on Tuesday when he updated the senate on the activities of his ministry to curb the spread of coronavirus in the country. He told principal officers of the senate that Ihekweazu was quarantined because he just returned from China. Ehanire said it is the standard practice for those who just returned from China, where the disease broke out in December, to be quarantined. An NCDC source told TheCable that Ihekweazu went for a high-level delegation meeting of the World Health Organisation in China. The source, who said the NCDC DG is under self-quarantine at his residence, refused to disclose the location. Credit: The Cable
