The Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, has said that he resisted shedding tears while watching displaced persons queuing for distribution of relief materials. Zulum stated this during the distribution of food and non-food items to 19,000 displaced households at Gajiram, headquarters of Nganzai Local Government Areas of the state. The governor, who directly supervised the distribution of the items, was visibly dismayed over the life threatening and critical conditions being experienced by the displaced people occasioned by insurgency. He said, “When will our people stop queuing to receive relief items. “I charge you all to cooperate with the security operatives to enable them restore normalcy in our land so that our people can go back to their farmlands. “We cannot continue to depend on food aid to survive, with the kind of resources we inject into providing relief items you can only imagine the development projects we would have executed.” Zulum reiterated his commitment towards ending the insurgency so as to fast track resettlement, recovery and peace restoration process. He called on the elders, stakeholders and communities to cooperate with the security agencies by providing information on suspicious movements and activities in their communities. No fewer than 11,300 house wives received clothing materials and N5, 000 each, while 7,800 men received one bag of rice and maize as well as three litres of cooking oil each. The beneficiaries were displaced persons taking shelter in host communities and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps in the area.
