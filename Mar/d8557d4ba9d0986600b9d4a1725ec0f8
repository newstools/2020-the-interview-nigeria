The House of Representatives has started taking delivery of the Toyota Camry 2020 model cars acquired for members as official cars, otherwise called utility vehicles, according a report in The Punch. This is despite the various forms of hardship Nigerians have to deal with in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. The report said that the legislators, who  had at an executive (closed-door) session on February 5, 2020, resolved to purchase 400 units of the exotic car, have also kept sealed lips on the cost of each unit as the contract for the supply it was learnt was not awarded to accredited Toyota dealers. However, the report noted that the House procured the V6 Limited Edition variant of the car, even as the Chairman of the Committee on House Services, Mr. Wale Raji, who confirmed delivery of the cars declined to respond to further enquiries. The cars, which belong to the National Assembly, are usually auctioned to the lawmakers after four years.
