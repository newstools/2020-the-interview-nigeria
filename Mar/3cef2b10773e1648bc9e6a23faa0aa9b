The Ghanaian government has imposed travel restrictions on foreign nationals who reside or have been to any country that has recorded at least 200 cases of the coronavirus, Covid-19. According to news reports, the United States of America and virtually all the countries in Central and Western Europe fit that category. In a travel advisory released on Sunday by the Ghana’s Minister of Information, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, there will be a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine for persons who are otherwise allowed to enter the Ghanaian jurisdiction. Nkrumah said, “All travel to Ghana is strongly discouraged until further notice. Any traveler, except for Ghanaian citizens and persons with Ghana residence permits, who, within the last 14 days, has been to a country that has recorded at least 200 cases of Covid-19, will not be admitted into Ghanaian jurisdiction. Airlines are instructed not to allow such persons to embark. Border post are instructed not to allow such persons into the jurisdiction.” Nkrumah said guidelines for self-quarantine would be available at various Ghanaian ports of entry. Enforcement protocols, he said, “are being deployed in collaboration with state security and health authorities. Persons determined to be unable to satisfactorily self-quarantine will be quarantined by the State.”
