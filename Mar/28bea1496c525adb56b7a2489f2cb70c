Reactions have trailed the appointment of Adamawa-born senator, Elisha Abbo, as the patron of the Actors Guild of Nigeria. Abbo, who was caught on camera assaulting a sales girl in an Abuja sex toy shop and later apologised to Nigeria after a video of the incident went viral, was appointed as patron of the Actors Guild of Nigeria. However, this development appears not to go down well with two Nigerian actresses who expressed their dissatisfaction with Abbo’s appointment. Veteran actress, Hilda Dokubo condemned Abbo’s appointment, calling on members of Nigerian Guild of Actors to reject it. Dokuba said Abbo’s reputation is worse than COVID-19 and an abuser can not be patron of an organization she belongs. Similarly, Kate Henshaw expressed her displeasure with Abbo’s appointment as Actors Guild of Nigeria patron. She said, “I do not mince words when I say  @AbboElisha is NOT worthy to be a patron of the Actors Guild of Nigeria. We have women in this guild and we do not want to be slapped!”
