Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde, on Tuesday signed the State Security Network Agency (Àmọ̀tẹ́kùn) Bill in to law. South Western Nigeria Security Network codenamed Operation Amotekun, is a security outfit based in all the six states of the South Western, Nigeria, responsible for curbing insecurity in the region. Makinde, who made this announcement on his official twitter page, said Àmọ̀tẹ́kùn Corps was not a replacement for traditional security agencies but to complement the efforts of the Federal security agencies. He said, “This morning, I signed the State Security Network Agency (Àmọ̀tẹ́kùn) Bill, 2020 into law. It’s been a long & torturous journey which started as far back as July 2019. Today, history has been made as Oyo State joins other southwest states to have the Àmọ̀tẹ́kùn law in force. “I stated that the Àmọ̀tẹ́kùn Corps is not a replacement for our traditional security agencies. It is to complement the efforts of the Federal security agencies who are stretched to the limit as a result of pockets of insecurity all over Nigeria. “I seized the opportunity to thank our traditional security agencies for the work they are doing despite budgetary, operational and personnel deficits. And restated that the Àmọ̀tẹ́kùn Corps will meet some of these gaps which will help secure Oyo State better.”
