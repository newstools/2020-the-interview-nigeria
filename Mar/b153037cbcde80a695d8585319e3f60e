River State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has accused the government of President Muhammadu Buhari’s government of marginalising the state, saying the federal government excluded Rivers State from federal projects, while prominent sons and daughters of the state are sacked from federal appointments. Wike, who made this statement via his official twitter page, said the government of President Buhari had done nothing for the state. He said, “Are we really part of this country? Is Rivers State part of this country? They have taken away majority of the prominent positions occupied by our sons and daughters in the Federal Government. “Rivers State is part of this country. We didn’t commit any offence to warrant the total exclusion from Federal Projects under this dispensation. We need to work together to fight insecurity. It doesn’t matter the party that you belong to, let’s work together to save this country. Wike added that a south south minister in the Buhari government said that Rivers State was being denied projects because of kidnapping. He said. “It is unfortunate that one Minister from the South-South said that Rivers State is being denied projects because of kidnapping. It is painful. “There are killings all over the country.  Killings in different states. But they are siting projects in those states. But in Rivers State, not a single Federal Project. “Why should anyone play politics with the lives of people? I don’t need to be in your party for you to protect me.  We are brothers and we are all from one country.”
