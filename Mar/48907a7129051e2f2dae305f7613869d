The Nigerian First Lady, Aisha Buhari, is mobilising volunteers to donate medical suppliers to support the victims of the virus. She has appealed for donation of sanitisers, hand gloves, wipes, face masks, soaps and other items. Mrs. Buhari also appealed to people, who might want to give up their hospital buildings to contact her office or email her pet project, Future Assured, through covid19@futureassured.org.ng. The President’s wife made the appeal through her verified twitter handle, @aishambuhari. She tweeted, ‘Are you a health worker? Would you like to donate hand sanitisers, hand gloves, wipes, face masks, soaps, and other items? “Do you have a hospital facility to give out temporarily’.
