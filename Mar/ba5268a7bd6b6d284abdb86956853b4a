The Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonanya Onu, has said that his ministry has developed a new machine that can conduct all national elections the same day. Onu, who spoke with State House correspondents on Wednesday after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, stated that the FEC had been briefed on the machine in the performance assessment report he submitted. He added that the electronic voting machine would be solar-powered. The minster explained, “This voting solution will help us to have clean elections in Nigeria and will make it possible for us as a nation to conduct all our elections in one day at the same time. “All the elections, the national, state and local governments; seven of them can be conducted the same day.” Onu added that the other qualities of the machine included that fact that it’s paperless and also designed not to store data. “So, if somebody comes to snatch it away, it’s a waste of time.  As soon as data comes into it, it transmits it. So basically, you’ll have a system that will be addressing many of the problems that we have today in the conduct of our elections.” The minster said the ministry was in consultation with the Independent National Electoral Commission on the machine, which had also been presented to the National Economic Council. “We have gone to INEC on this to set up a committee; we also took this before the National Economic Council and we are still working to further improve on the system,” he added.
