The national chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole almost immediately after being suspended from his position on Wednesday by an Abuja high court filed an application appealing the ruling. No hearing date has however been set for his appeal. The suspension order by Justice Danlami Senchi followed an interlocutory application filed by Oluwale Afolabi seeking Oshiomhole’s removal as party chairman after he was suspended from the party at the ward level in Edo State. Justice Senchi said since Oshiomhole had been suspended by his Ward, he had no basis parading himself as the chairman of APC. The ruling which also ordered the APC to deny the embattled party chairman access to the national secretariat was imposed pending the determination of the substantive suit brought against him. Oshiomhole’s spokesperson, Simon Egbegbulem, has however said his principal remains the chairman of the party following their appeal of the high court ruling and stay of execution at the Appeal Court.
