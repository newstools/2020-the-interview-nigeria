The Nigerian First Lady, Aisha Buhari, on Monday has called on the federal government to compel a total lockdown in the country in order to curtail the spread of COVID-19 among citizens. Mrs. Buhari noted said allowing people go to work could be counter productive to efforts to curtail the spread of Corona Virus. Mrs. Aisha who spoke via her official twitter handle on Monday, commended state governors for closing schools to make children stay back at home. She said, “It is commendable that state governors have closed down schools; however, this could be counterproductive if parents are still going to work.” “We should not isolate students and expose their parents. Let us remember that they will meet at home. #TotalLockDown #StayAtHome”
