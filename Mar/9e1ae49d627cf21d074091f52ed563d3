A Yola High Court on Monday sentenced the former Executive Secretary Christian Pilgrim Welfare Board (CPWB), Bishop Jinga Mayo to five years imprisonment without option of fine. The former executive secretary was charged to court by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Related Offences Commission (ICPC) for corruption. The presiding judge, Justice Nathan Musa, also sentenced Bishop Jinga to six months imprisonment with N50,000 option of fine. However, the jail terms are to run concurrently. Jinga was convicted for diverting the sum of N69.189m out of the N346.8m released to the board by the former administration of Governor Muhammad Umar Jibrilla Bindo  for the 2016 Christian pilgrimage. The court convicted Bishop him on count 2 and 3, for converting governmentâ€™s money for his personal use, while discharging and acquitting him on count 1 for failure of prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. It could be recalled that the accused had earlier told the court that he had used the money in sponsoring Agricultural Training Programme organised for Christian Pilgrims in Israel.
