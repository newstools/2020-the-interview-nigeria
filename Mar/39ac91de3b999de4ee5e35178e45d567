The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed the application of the All Progressives Congress (APC) seeking to review the judgement on Zamfara governorship election. The court has, with this judgement, also affirmed Bello Matawalle of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP) as the duly elected  governor of Zamfara State. The apex court said the application to review its earlier judgement was a gross abuse of court, frivolous and grossly vexatious. The apex court had in an earlier judgement nullified the victory of the APC in the Zamfara governorship, national and state assemblies elections for not conducting a valid primary, ordering the Independent National Electoral Commission to issue the certificate of return to the candidate of the political party with the next highest vote in the election. The apex court awarded N2m cost against the APC to be paid to the respondents.
