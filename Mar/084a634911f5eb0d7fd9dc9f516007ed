A former vice president of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, on Wednesday donated N50m  as relief fund for Nigerians as the country combats the COVID-19 pandemic. Atiku, who was People Democratic Party’s presidential candidate in 2919, made this known in a statement on Wednesday. He also called on the government and mobile telephone companies to provide palliatives to cushion the ripple effects of the pandemic on citizens. The statement reads in part:  “At an approximate 30 million households or thereabouts, the government should devise modalities to distribute N10,000 as a supplement for foodstuff to each household, among other palliative measures, with no one left behind. “I also call on all Mobile Telephony Companies in Nigeria to urgently develop mobile money platforms so that the government can reach the unbanked with financial assistance. I also urge these telecommunications firms to offer each of the 100 million mobile phone lines in Nigeria free credit of at least ₦1500 per mobile line, so that Nigerians who show symptoms, or those who just want information, can call the nearest available health facility, or even an ambulance service, as the case may be. “To this end, Priam Group pledges N50 million on my behalf as my humble contribution to a relief Fund that will form part of the stimulus package.”
