The Federal Government has begun consultations with relevant stakeholders on a possible reduction of the pump price of petrol in the wake of the crash of crude oil prices. The Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, disclosed this in Abuja on Friday when he spoke to State House Correspondents after the committee raised by the President Muhammadu Buhari to assess the impact of Coronavirus on the economy, met with him at the Presidential Villa. Sylva explained that while no decisions had been taken to cut the pump price, consultations were ongoing. “We are still consulting, we are still following it closely. Of course, usually, the product prices follow the crude oil price but we are still consulting. “We will get back to you, please, be patient”, he stated.
