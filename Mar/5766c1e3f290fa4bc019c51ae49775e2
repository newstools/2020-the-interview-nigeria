President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday expressed deep sadness and regret over the latest bandits attack in Kaduna State, saying bandits were unleashing fury and frustration on innocent citizens. Over the weekend, bandits attacked Kerewa village in Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State, killing about 51 persons. In a statement by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media & Publicity, President Buhari said his “administration would not be blackmailed by criminals to abandon the current military operations against them.” “From reports received, it is obvious that these bandits are unleashing their fury and frustration on innocent people because of the ongoing military and police offensive against them in the Birnin Gwari and Kaduru forests,” he said. President Buhari assured the people of Kaduna State and other parts of the country that his government would continue to deploy all available resources to fight the bandits and bring them to their knees. He added, “These criminals should make no mistake that they can establish a reign of terror on the people without feeling the full might of the government which was elected to protect the citizens. “The criminals cannot be lucky always; we are determined to frustrate and defeat them, and no matter how long they run or where they hide, they would be smoked out and brought to justice.”
