People Living With Disabilities (PLWDs), have decried the government’s decision to lock down in order to tame the spread of COVID-19, saying that their welfare was not considered before the government took the decision. Speaking to The Interview on phone, the national PRO of PLWDs, Comrade Alhassan Ibrahim Ganye, said the decision was impulsive, harsh and hurtful, adding that it had further worsened the plight of the PLWDs. He stated, “The decision was rash, impulsive and hurting to our members who even before the introduction of the policy were hamstrung by myriads of economic challenges. “We thought the government will provide palliatives for us before introducing the measure. But as I’m talking to you, we are left to our fate. “With the decision, we are now living between the devil and the deep blue sea without a substantive future,” he said. He called on the federal government to consider them in the proposed stimulus package in order to cushion the effect of the policy on them.
