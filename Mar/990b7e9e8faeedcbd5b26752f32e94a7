Muhammad Sanusi II who was deposed as Emir of Kano on Monday and later banished from the state plans to challenge the latter action in court, his lawyer, Abubakar Mahmoud, has said. Addressing the media on Tuesday, Mahmoud said he had gotten directives from his client, Muhammad Sanusi, through his Chief of Staff, Munir Sanusi.to challenge the banishment in court. The deposed emir’s legal counsel however said there was presently no plan to challenge his removal by the government of Abdallahi Ganduje. Sanusi had earlier in video circulating on social media said he had accepted his fate as an act of God in regard to the dethronement, calling on supporters to pledge allegiance to whoever would be named the new emir. Aminu Ado Bayero, son of the late emir Ado Bayero has been named as Sanusi’s replacement. Alluding to Sanusi’s banishment and confinement to Nasarawa, Mahmoud said his client had not been served with an arrest warrant when he was picked up at the emir’s palace on Monday. Going by the Emirate Council Law, Mahmoud said the Kano State Executive Council lacked the powers to banish the emir. The banishment, he said, violates Sanusi’s human rights.
