Adamawa State government on Tuesday told the organised labour in the State that it could pay March salary with the consequential adjustment of the national minimum wage agreed upon and duly signed with the joint trade unions. A statement signed by the governor’s Director General, Media and Communications, Solomon Kumangar, noted that the action was due to the dwindling resources following the advent of COVID-19 into the country. “The State Government wishes to inform the entire labour force that due to the economic crunch imposed by the alarming effects of COVID-19 pandemic, it is unable to pay March salaries with the consequential adjustment of the national minimum wage agreed upon and duly signed with the joint trade unions. “For the avoidance of doubt, government is irrevocably committed to paying the consequential adjustment with the backlog/arrears as soon as the COVID-19 and its negative economic implications abate. “It should be noted that the government decided on this and other cost saving measures to enable it undertake basic services. “Finally, government assures that the welfare of the workforce remains paramount and the centerpiece of governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri’s cardinal agenda,” the statement said.
