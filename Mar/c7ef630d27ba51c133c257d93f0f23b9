Former President Olusegun Obadanjo has written a letter to Muhammad Sanusi II sympathizing with him over his dethronement as the Emir of Kano on Monday. Affectionately calling the former emir his brother, Obasanjo described Sanusi’s removal by the governor of Kano, Abdullahi Ganduje, as undeserved, encouraging the former emir to continue fighting for the best interest of the country. Sanusi was later banished to from Kano and flown to Nasarawa State where he is expected to live out his life in exile. He was replaced as the Emir by Aminu Bayero, who was previously the Emir of Bichi, one of the emirate councils that  governor Ganduje created. Obasanjo’s letter read, “I woke up this morning and after my morning exercise, devotion and my morning meeting with my staff, I heard the sad and the good news of your removal by the Executive Council of the Kano State Government. “It is sad because it was undeserved. It is good because you have paid the price. My prayer is that God should give you the courage to continue on the path that you have chosen for yourself in the best interest of our country and humanity.”
