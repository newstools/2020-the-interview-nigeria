The Federal Government has ordered the closure of all land borders of the country for four weeks as a precautionary measure to curtail the spread of Coronavirus. The announcement was made on Monday by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, who doubles as Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19. Mustapha also announced an indefinite suspension of the weekly federal executive council meeting, while also advising residents of Lagos and Abuja, the two cities mostly affected by coronavirus, to stay at home and avoid mass congregations. The SGF noted that the border closure and suspension of the council meetings were recommendations of the Presidential Task Force, which were approved by the president. He said, “All land borders that have been under partial closure shall now be closed for human traffic for four weeks effective, 23rd March 2020; in order to protect Federal Civil and Public Servants. A circular to be issued by the Head of Civil Service of the Federation shall direct on actions to be taken immediately. “We commend Nigerians for stepping out to report and/or make it neuritis through the dedicated hotlines. Records show that on Sunday, 22nd March, 2020, over 4500 calls were received. This shows the high level of awareness amongst Nigerians. Nigeria now has 36 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with one recorded death, according to National Centre for Disease Control.
