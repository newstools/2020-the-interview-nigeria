Muhammad Sanusi II has been dethroned as the Emir of Kano by the government of Abdullahi Ganduje. This is according a statement from the Secretary to the Kano State Government, Usman Alhaji. Alhaji who said a new emir would soon be announced added that the Sanusi’s  removal was necessitated by the disrespect the emir had shown the office of the governor in violation of part section A-E of Kano State law. He said, “The Kano State Executive Council under the chairmanship of his excellency, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has unanimously approved the immediate removal/dethrone meant of Emir of Kano Emirate Muhammad Sanusi II. “The Emir of Kano is in total disrespect to lawful instruction from the office of the state governor and lawful authorities, including his persistent refusal to attend official meetings and programmes organised by the government without any lawful justification which amount to total insubordination.” The statement further read, “The removal was reached in order to safeguard sanctity, culture, tradition, religion and prestige of the Kano Emirate built over a thousand years.” Ganduje and Sanusi had been having a running battle with the deposed emir coming under probe by the state assembly and Kano State anti-graft commission.
