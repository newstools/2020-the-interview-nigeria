The Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) has set electronic platforms to interface with stakeholders in the telecommunications industry and the general public as a means of managing the outbreak of coronavirus. According to a statement by Henry Nkemadu, NCC’s director, public affairs, on the Commission has put in place measures to support initiatives by other stakeholders to curtail this scourge, saying Nigerians infected with the virus should take advantage of the Emergency Communication Centres by dialing its toll free number 112 during emergencies. This is just as he stated  that all social and official visits to the Commission had been cancelled immediately and visitors advised to use relevant online platforms and or telephone services in accessing the Commission’s services. Nkemadu said, “in conjunction with industry players and all other government agencies, has agreed to reduce the frequency of physical meetings all through the period of the Coronavirus outbreak and considered alternative electronic meeting platforms, in order to reduce person-to-person contact that may arise from travels or meetings.” According to Nkemadu, “Departments within the Commission that interface with customers have developed e-platforms where all licensing requests, consumer complaints and base transceiver station (BTS) investigation requests could be channeled or provide designated e-mail addresses to be used for such requests throughout the pandemic period.” The Commission has also approved resource sharing by operators throughout the period of Coronavirus. These include fibre optics cables and other resources in the event of cable cuts and other unforeseen developments during the period of Coronavirus. It directed Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to ensure that their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes are in tandem with government initiatives to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide safety and support aid materials that will protect the public against Coronavirus. Nkemadu added, “Is also in support of RoP for suppliers that are involved in supplies of fuels, foods and other support services to telecom operators, to allow for free movement in the event of partial or total lockdown as a result of the Coronavirus.”
