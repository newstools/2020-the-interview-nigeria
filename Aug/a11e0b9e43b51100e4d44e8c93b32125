The State Security Service (SSS) has castigated former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Obadiah Mailafia for claiming that a sitting governor of a northern state is the commander of Boko Haram in Nigeria. Mailafia made the comments in an interview with Nigeria Info Fm station on Monday. He was later questioned by the SSS on Wednesday for several hours, while the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) imposed a N5m fine on the radio station for providing its platform to engage in hate speech. Media and civil society groups have however condemned the N5M fine imposed on the station as a threat to freedom of speech.

The agency, in the statement said, “Mailafiya, as a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and currently, a Directing Staff at Nigeria’s foremost Policy Research Institute, the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), Kuru, has unhindered access to government platforms.

But regrettably, he chose to cross the lines of decorum and conduct expected of a personality of his status.” Afunanya said, “It is disappointing that he never took advantage of these to reach any of the security or related agencies to share the so called information at his disposal. This, he has agreed to be a grievous error on his part. “It, however, suggests his mischief and determination to use the fake news he spewed to incite the people under his control.
