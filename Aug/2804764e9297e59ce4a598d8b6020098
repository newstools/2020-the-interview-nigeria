The management of Air Peace on Monday announced that it was terminating the appointment of some of its pilots. Announcing this in a statement on Monday, Air Peace said the decision to terminate the appointment of some of its pilots was due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on the industry. “The Management of Air Peace wishes to state that it has taken a very painful but rightful decision, in the circumstances the airline has found itself as a result of the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations and financial health, to terminate the employment of some of its pilots. “This decision was taken for the greater good of the company and its almost 3000 workforce, the affected pilots inclusive. “The airline cannot afford to toe the path of being unable to continue to fulfill its financial obligations to its staff, external vendors, aviation agencies, maintenance organisations, insurance companies, banks and other creditors hence the decision to restructure its entire operations with a view to surviving the times”, the statement read.

The new salaries reflect a 0%-40% cut of the former salary depending on the salary grades of every staff. “Even after the cuts, it was obvious that for us to be able to sustain our operations and survive the times, some jobs must inevitably have to go”, the statement said.
