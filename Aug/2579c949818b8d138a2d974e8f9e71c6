President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday cautioned the leadership of the All Progressives Congress ahead of the Edo State governorship poll, against repeating its past mistakes as witnessed in Zamfara and Rivers States in 2019. Buhari asked the party to ensure that it would win the governorship election through constitutional means and not by crisis or any other methods. The President spoke in Abuja when he received the party’s Edo governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, at the State House.
