The Director General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, said the health agency was in desperate need of the RNA extraction kits for expansion of its COVID-19 testing capacity Ihekweazu, who made this known in a tweet on Sunday, gave the name of products and the manufacturers of the test kits needed. He said, “We’re desperately looking for more RNA extraction kits as we expand #COVID19 testing. Product: Total viral RNA extraction kits (preferably spin column and with a lysis buffer). Manufacturers: Qiagen, ThermoFischer, SeeGene, Inqaba, LifeRiver etc.” At a briefing of the Presidential Task Force for COVID-19 in Abuja last week Tuesday, the NCDC DG said that the centre would increase the testing capacity to 4000 per day across the country with 2000 samples to be done per day in Lagos State.
