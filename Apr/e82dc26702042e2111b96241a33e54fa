President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the implementation of the Stephen Oransaye Committee report on the rationalisation of government agencies. Mrs Zainab Ahmed, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, disclosed this on Channels TV programme, Politics Today on Wednesday. She said that the administration of President Buhari was looking at implementing the recommendations of the Oronsaye report. “We are looking at doing that. The President has approved that this administration should implement the recommendations of the Oransaye report. “So, the Oransaye report is a report that has reviewed the whole of the size of government. It has made very significant recommendation in reducing the number of agencies, merging some agencies together”, Mrs Ahmed said. Inaugurated by former president Goodluck Jonathan in 2011, the Rationalisation and Restructuring of Federal Government Parastatals, Commissions and Agencies, commonly referred to as the Oronsaye Committee, recommended the merger, conversion and scrapping of many agencies. The Oronsaye Committee recommended the scrapping of 102 federal government statutory agencies from the present 263; the abolition of 38 agencies; merger of 52 and reversion of 14 to mere departments in some ministries. In addition, the report recommended the discontinuation of government funding of professional bodies and councils.
