The Nigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami, has said that no licence has been issued to any provider for the Fifth Generation Mobile Networks (5G) in Nigeria. Pantami, in a statement on Saturday, said the National Frequency Management Council (NFMC), which he is chairman, had not deliberated on or released any bulk frequency spectrum for the deployment of 5G. According to him, a three-month study trial commenced on the November 25, 2019 in order to critically review and study the health and security implications of deploying 5G in Nigeria. As part of the study trial process, he said, “I directed the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to ensure that a team of experts, security agencies and other stakeholders fully participate in the trial process and my office also invited these agencies to participate in the trial.” Pantami however said the trial process had been concluded and the study and reporting process is currently ongoing. President Muhammadu Buhari, he said, placed a premium on the welfare, health and security of Nigerians. “As such, our desire for technological advancement will never be at the expense of the health and welfare of our citizens. “Government will not act on the speculations only, but rather we will take an informed decision on 5G after due consultation with experts and the public.  I have also directed the NCC to engage citizens on any questions or concerns they may have regarding 5G,” the minister stated.
