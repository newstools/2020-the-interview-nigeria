Menegian Saro-Wiwa, a son of the late Ogoni activist, Ken Saro-Wiwa, has died of COVID-19 at a London hospital. Menegian, who was 50 at the time of his death, was said to have had some underlying health conditions before contracting the virus. According his sister, Noo, who announced his death in an Instagram post on Thursday, the late Menegian, who died on Monday left behind a son, Louis. She said, “We said goodbye to my brother, Gian, on Monday. “He had COVID-19 combined with underlying health conditions. “Gian was the smartest and most talented out of all of us: a champion sprinter at school, a poet, an artist, budding engineer, a self-taught guitarist and pianist. But mental health issues limited his life from age 16 onwards. “I took this photo of him a few months ago before he was hospitalised. “A kind and beautiful soul, always wanting the best for his family, always praying for our future success while being eternally optimistic about his own. And, of course, always loving his music. He leaves a wonderful son, Louis.”
