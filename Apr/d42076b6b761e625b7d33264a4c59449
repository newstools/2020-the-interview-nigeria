Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, has said that the world needs World Health Organisation (WHO) now than ever and that starving the organisation of funds at this time is dangerous. Gates, who made this statement via his official twitter handle on Wednesday, said the world was going through a health crisis and funding WHO was crucial to overcoming the global pandemic. “Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds,” he said. American president, Donald Trump, who had accused the WHO of mismanaging the COVID-19 pandemic, had said on Tuesday that the US was suspending funding to the organisation. “Today I am instructing my administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization’s role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,” Trump had stated in a White House briefing. Gates also said the WHO was playing a crucial role in the fight against coronavirus pandemic and that no organisation could replace it. “Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped no other organization can replace them. The world needs @WHO now more than ever,” he stated.
