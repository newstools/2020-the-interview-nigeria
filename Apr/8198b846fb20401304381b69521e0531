Nollywood actress, Funke Akindele-Bello, and her husband, Abdulrasheed Bello a.k.a JJC Skills, have been handed a 14-day community service sentence by an Ogba magistrate court in Lagos State. The couple on Monday pleaded guilty to breaking the Lagos law mandating social distancing in order to combat an infectious disease. The state government had placed a ban on social gatherings of more than 20 people to combat the coronavirus pandemic in state, which is the most affected by the outbreak in Nigeria. Akindele-Bello and her husband were also fined N100, 000 each. Under the Lagos State law, where there is violation of a close down or stay at home order, security agencies shall have the power to arrest without warrant and may detain any person who violates the close down or stay at home order for at least 48 hours. The couple posted videos of themselves, along with guests partying on Saturday at their Amen Estate Lekki residence, in defiance of a stay-at-home order imposed on residents of Lagos by the state and federal governments. They were thereafter arrested by the police on Sunday. Chief Magistrate Aje-Afunwa sentenced both to community service for 14 days starting from 9am to 12pm each day. The sentence involves them sensitising the public on the COVID-19 pandemic. The party held on Saturday was in celebration of Belloâ€™s birthday and had in attendance, Naira Marley, who is now also in custody, along with other celebrities.
