The Catholic Bishop of Yola Diocese, Dr. Stephen Dami Mamza, has said that the church has made available the pastoral centre in Yola to Adamawa State government in support of the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. Bishop Dami Mamza stated this while briefing Journalists in Yola to clear the air on the confusion that the church offered Saint Peters Minor seminary to serve as isolation centre. He explained that when government announced partial lockdown in the state, the Catholic Church decided to make available its 100-room pastoral centre Yola behind St. Peters seminary to government as contribution to fight the pandemic. Bishop Mamza, also the state chairman of the Christians Association of Nigeria (CAN), however commended Governor Ahmadu Fintiri for relaxing the lockdown while prevailing on the residents to reciprocate by complying with directives and help tips to avoid contracting the virus. “There is no need to panic because government seems ready to tackle any case of the diseases. “People should abide by health regulations on preventing coronavirus such as avoiding crowds and observing social distancing as well as regular washing of hands and maintaining personal hygiene,” he stated. The clergyman stressed that managing the pandemic was a collective responsibility as the virus does not have respect for religion, tribe or political learning of any person.
