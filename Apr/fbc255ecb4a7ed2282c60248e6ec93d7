Health workers in Lagos will soon start knocking on doors in search of anyone suffering symptoms associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The healthcare officials who would be armed with electronic questionnaires, will comb through the different communities in the state. In a message to Lagos residents on Thursday, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, sought their cooperation to help detect unreported cases of the virus either in homes or in health facilities. Sanwo-Olu said, “In the coming days, some of our health workers will be moving around in pairs to administer an electronic questionnaire at homes and healthcare facilities to make enquiries about some symptoms like cough, cold and fever. “This is in a bid to intensify our search for possible cases of #COVID19 in different communities across the State known as ‘Active Case Search’.” These officials, he said can be identified with a #COVID19 outbreak response tag or a letter from the LGA. He said, “I implore you to give them your maximum support by providing accurate information that would help in containing this #COVID19 pandemic quickly. Sanwo-Olu also disclosed that they had discharged seven more patients who have fully recovered and tested negative twice consecutively for #COVID19. “This brings to 39 the number of discharged patients in Lagos,” the governor noted. The patients, he said, included one female and six males; three of the discharged male patients are foreign nationals; two Ukrainians and one Italian. He added, “As we look forward to more great news in the coming days, I implore you all to support our offensive against #COVIDー19 by complying with our directives and taking responsibility for yourselves and your community.”
