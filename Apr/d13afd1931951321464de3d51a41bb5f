Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai has extended the lockdown order in the state for another 30 days. The governor, who announced this in a statement on Sunday said the decision to extend the lockdown was made based on the recommendation of Kaduna State Committee on COVID 19, chaired by deputy governor, Hadiza Balarabe. The lockdown extension takes effect from April 26, 2020. The statement said, “The decision follows a recommendation to that effect by the State Standing Committee on COVID-19, chaired by @DrHadiza Balarabe. “With COVID-19 cases rising rapidly in neighbouring states and the FCT, and with strong evidence of interstate travel being a major means of spreading the virus, the Standing Committee’s evaluation is that measures to protect Kaduna State residents require further strengthening.” . “Malam Nasir @elrufai has endorsed this evaluation. Quarantine Orders have been reviewed to strengthen the provisions against unauthorised movements. Henceforth, only Wednesdays will be lockdown-free, until the trajectory of Covid-19 infections becomes clearer.” Governor el-rufai also that said wearing face masks was now compulsory for anyone who must step out of their homes. He said, “All persons that venture out of their homes for whatever reason must wear face masks and observe social distancing everywhere they go, in markets and in authorised vehicles.
