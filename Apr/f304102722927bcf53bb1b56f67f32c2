The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has debunked claims that the agency spent N1bn on sending text messages to Nigerians. NCDC said the report was false as the agency had been sending text messages to updates and inform Nigerians on Coronavirus pandemic at no cost. The agency, in a tweet, said, claims that it had spent N1bn on text messages should be disregarded. The tweet read, “The headline claiming that NCDC has spent N1 billion on SMS to Nigerians is FALSE.” The agency further revealed that the text messages sent to Nigerians were sponsored by telecommunications companies in Nigeria. “While communication through SMS is a key part of our #COVID19 response strategy, this has been largely provided as in-kind support by @AirtelNigeria @MTNNG @GloWorld, the NCDC said.
