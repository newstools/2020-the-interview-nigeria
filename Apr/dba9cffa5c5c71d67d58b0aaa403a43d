The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, has called for investigation and prosecution of security officers guilty of human rights violations while enforcing lockdown order. Lawan, who made this statement via his official twitter handle, was reacting to National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) report which disclosed that 18 persons had been killed by security officers while enforcing the lockdown order. He said, “I am saddened by the report by the National Human Right Commission (NHRC) that 18 persons were killed by high-handed security officers tasked to enforce the stay-at-home directives against #Covid19”. Condemning high handedness of security officers, Lawan called for investigation into the NHRC report and that security officers found guilty should be prosecuted. He said, “Extra-judicial killings, in whatever guise, should be discouraged in our society. It is a tragedy that those asked to enforce compliance with emergency measures adopted for public safety are now being accused of the needless and totally avoidable deaths of citizens. “While I condemn in strong terms the actions of this high-handed security officers, I call for a thorough investigation of the cases and that those indicted be promptly brought to account. “Any officer found culpable of unprofessional use of weapons should as a standard practice be made to face prosecution.” He also urged Nigerians to continue to cooperate with the authorities as they strive to defend the country against COVID-19.
