The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has debunked claims that Nollywood actress, Funke Adekindele-Bello is their brand ambassador. Akindele-Bello, who was arrested for hosting house party in contravention of the lockdown order by the federal government, was said to be NCDC ambassador. However, in a tweet, the NCDC said Funke Akindele-Bello was not their ambassador and that engaging brand ambassadors was not part of NCDC’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic. “As an agency of the Federal Government of Nigeria, NCDC has not engaged brand ambassadors as part of our response to #COVID19. “We continue to emphasise that all Nigerians maintain #socialdistancing to prevent the spread of #COVID19, NCDC tweeted. In a similar vein, Dettol Nigeria clarified NCDC’s role in the public enlightenment on Coronavirus video in which Akindele-Bello featured, in a statement. The company stated, “We have been made aware through social media that Funke Akindele recently, acting in her personal capacity, had a celebration which is against the caution to the public on social distancing during the covid-19 pandemic. “The NCDC partnered with Dettol on a public service message to educate our communities about preventive measures against COVID-19. Funke is not a brand ambassador of the NCDC.”
