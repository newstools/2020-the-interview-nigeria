The Lamido Adamawa, Dr. Muhammadu Barkindo Aliyu Musdafa, has ordered the immediate closure of all five daily prayer mosques in the state, in a renewed effort to contain the spread of novel Coronavirus pandemic. Although the state is yet to record any confirmed case of  COVID-19, measures have been place by relevant authorities just as the two weeks lockdown order imposed in the state, is due to lapse on Tuesday. It could be recalled that Jummaat Mosques in the state, except the daily prayers mosques, were all shut down for about two weeks now. However, with this new order by the monarch residents are now expected to say their daily five prayers at home. It’s not yet clear whether the state government will review it’s lockdown by Tuesday or not as economic hardship bites harder and residents groaning that they are yet to receive any palliatives.
