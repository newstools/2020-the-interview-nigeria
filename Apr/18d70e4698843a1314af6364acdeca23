One of the sons of Kaduna State governor, Bello el-Rufai, has threatened to sue a Premium Times reporter, Samuel Ogundipe, arrested. Premium Times had reported how Bello threatened to gang rape the mother of a twitter user on Sunday. “In an escalation of social media bickering, a Nigerian governor’s son publicly threatened to gang rape a senior citizen on Sunday. “Bello El-Rufai, one of the sons of the Kaduna governor, issued the threat in a private message to a Twitter user following arguments about politics. “Tell your mother I’m passing her to my friends tonight,” Mr. El-Rufai said to the twitter user, before adding an ethnic diatribe: “No Igbo sounds please!”, Premium Times reported. Apparently reacting to Premium Times story on Monday, Bello said he would sue the reporter who wrote the story and that he was anticipating a #FreeSamuel hashtag. Bello said, “Oh @SamuelOgundipe, our hired PDP columnist, you in particular were the last piece of the puzzle. “I assure you that my lawyers will get to you to prove the usage/threat of rape. The onus is on you. I eagerly anticipate the #FreeSamuel hashtag. Thanks for completing the jigsaw.” Speaking with The Interview on Monday, Managing Editor of Premium Times, Mr. Idris Akinbajo, said the newspaper stood by its story and would be ready to meet Bello in court. “Premium Times notes the Tweet by Bello El-Rufai regarding the story by our reporter, Samuel Ogundipe. We stand by our story and await any (legal) communication from Mr. El-Rufai or his lawyers.” When asked if Premium Times was worried over the safety of Samuel Ogundipe given Bello’s threat, Akinbajo said, “We believe that Mr. El-Rufai will utilise legal and democratic means to express whatever complaints he has and have no reason to fear for the safety of our reporter.”
