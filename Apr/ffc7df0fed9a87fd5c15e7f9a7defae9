The Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and Planning  pleaded with the founder of the electronic automobile company, Tesla Inc., Elon Musk, to support Nigeria with 100-500 ventilators. The South African-American billionaire had said in a tweet that his company was supplying ventilators to hospitals worldwide. The tweet reads: “We have extra FDA-approved ventilators. Will ship to hospitals worldwide within Tesla delivery regions. Device & shipping cost are free. Only requirement is that the vents are needed immediately for patients, not stored in a warehouse. Please me or @Tesla know. Responding to this tweet, however, the ministry of finance, via its official Twitter handle said that Nigerian government is in need of 100 – 500 ventilators. The tweet read: “Dear @elonmusk @Tesla Federal Government of Nigeria needs support with 100-500 ventilators to assist with #Covid19 cases arising every day in Nigeria.” The minister however pulled down the tweet a few hours after coming under criticism from Nigerians on Twitter.
