The Emir of Jere, Kargako Local Government, and one time secretary to the Kaduna State Government, Dr. Sa’ad Usman is dead. This was announced by his younger brother, Aminu Jere on Wednesday. Dr. Usman was the husband of a Nigerian former minister of finance, Nenadi Usman. In January 2014, the emir suffered injuries to the head after he was attacked by locals in Jere during his attempt to settle a community dispute. He was later flown to and hospitalised in the United Kingdom. Aminu Jere in the post said, “I just lost a brother in person of HRH the Sarkin Jete, Dr. Sa’ad Usman, PhD. Janazah will take place at Jere town, by 2pm Insha Allah.”
