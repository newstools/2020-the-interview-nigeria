The Nigerian Medical Association has threatened to review its participation in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic if the federal government does not rescind its decision to bring Chinese doctors in its fight against COVID-19. A team of Chinese doctors are expected to arrive in the country in the coming days. The association complained of the deplorable working conditions medical workers in the country were forced to work under, particularly the lack protective equipment, testing centers for Coronavirus and the lack of insurance for the medical workforce in Nigeria. The NMA, in a statement on Sunday accused the government of not consulting it before inviting the 18-man team of Chinese medical professionals. They suggested that any experience the Chinese doctors might have from combating the pandemic in China could be shared through digital technology. The NMA was however not against, “The donation of equipment and supplies because we can always do with such support as even the developed countries receive support.” The statement signed by the president of NMA, Dr. Francis Faduyile indirectly blamed the arrival of Chinese doctors in Italy for the spike and new cases and increase in the death toll from coved-19 in the country. The association said, “In rejecting the invitation of Chinese doctors, the NMA would instead urge the federal government to review and approve better welfare incentives to the frontline medical personnel.” The NMA said it, “would loathe review ping her participation in the fight against COVID-19 considering the grave implications and the risk to the lives of her members should the government go ahead with this I’ll-thought-out invitation at this time.”
