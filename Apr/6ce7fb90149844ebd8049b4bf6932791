The Ekiti State government has appointed Mr. Femi Adeoye as the COVID-19 Response ambassador in the state. Adeoye is the man who insisted that his son who returned to Ekiti from Lagos must be tested and certified COVID-19 free before he could come home with him. In a video that went viral, Mr. Adeoye was seen insisting that his son, who had just arrived the state from Lagos State could not follow him home because of the fear of contracting COVID-19. Adeoye’s action attracted the attention of the state governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, who invited him to a meeting where he read to him a letter of commendation. Fayemi said Adeoye showed a high level of courage by considering the well-being of the entire state in his action. He said, “By, in accordance with existing regulations, denying his son entry into his household having travelled from places under Federal lockdown against his fatherly advice, Mr. Adeoye has proved to be a worthy ambassador of Ekiti State resolve to end the #COVID19 pandemic. “The government and the good people of Ekiti State are very proud of this chivalrous act of courage and principle which are the hallmarks of the Ekiti person. “Ekiti State will in future recognise Mr. Adeoye’s valour as an example of the rebirth of Ekiti Values Orientation which is the central focus of Governor Kayode Fayemi’s administration. Fayemi added that the state would be delighted to have Mr. Adeoye as COVID-19 response Ambassador in Ekiti State, helping to propagate the message as a member of the COVID-19 Task Force in the state.
