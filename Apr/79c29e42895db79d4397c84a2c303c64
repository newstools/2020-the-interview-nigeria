The Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) has asked the federal government to think twice about bringing in Chinese medical experts to help combat the coronavirus. The NUJ President, Chris Isiguzo, in a statement on Saturday said it would be counterproductive to bring in doctors from China, opening up the opportunity for Nigerians to be used as experimental guinea pigs. He said, “It is pertinent to plead with the federal government to stop this medical team from coming to Nigeria because of the Italian example where there was an inexplicable spike in COVID-19 related deaths when the Chinese doctors arrived the country. The Nigerian government, he also said should, “As a matter of urgent concern investigate the allegation, that what is happening today is associated with the launch of the 5G communication network as Nigerians are becoming more agitated.” The minister of health, Osagie Ehanire, had on Friday said that an 18-man team of Chinese doctors, nurses and medical advisers were expected in the country to help with the fight against Coronavirus. He also said a special cargo aircraft was expected to leave Nigeria in a few days to collect medical equipment like personal protective equipment, and ventilators. According to the minister, some 3,000 samples have presently been tested in the country for the Coronavirus pandemic. Nigeria, as at April 4, has 210 confirmed cases and had recorded four deaths.
