Bello el Rufai, one of the sons of Kaduna State governor,  Nasir el-Rufai, has apologized to the public for threatening to gang-rape the mother of a twitter user who called him “Daddy’s boy”. Bello, who had earlier vowed not to withdraw his statement and even threatened to sue the journalist who reported his obnoxious tweets, tendered an apology via his official twitter handle on Friday. He said, “A few days ago I made a comment that was wrong, unbecoming and contrary to the values on which I was raised. I wish to withdraw that statement and apologise to the gentleman concerned for the hurtful comment. I also apologise for appearing to attack an entire ethnic group for the misdeed of one person. “I regret the sexual innuendo in the private message and apologise unreservedly for it. I wish to state very strongly that the statement was made during the heat of the moment and I wish to put on the record that I do not condone sexual violence. “I certainly do not believe that there can be any justification for gender based crimes. I am learning from the episode in the continuous journey of emerging as a better person. Bello also said that the intensity around lewd statement he made probably stemmed from the fact that he was one el Rufai’s sons. He added, “I have apologised to my mother in person. I have also reached out to the women in my life and apologised. I realise that the intensity around this matter stems partly from my surname. “The mistakes I made with the private message and in smearing an ethnic group because of one person are now being replicated by people that are attacking my parents and my family because of my conduct… “I apologise to the general public in recognition of the duty to acknowledge wrongdoing and strive to be better.”
