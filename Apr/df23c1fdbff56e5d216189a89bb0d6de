Former president Obasanjo on Saturday sent a letter of condolence to President Muhammadu Buhari over the death of his Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari. Kyari died on Friday after battling with the complications of COVID-19 which he contracted late March after an official trip to Germany. Obasanjo in the letter  said, “I received the news of the demise of Alhaji Abba Kyari, your Chief of Staff, over Friday night, with great sadness, as he lost the battle against the dreadful killer disease“. “Abba Kyari’s death must be painful to you and to his family and friends, but you can all take solace in the fact that he died in harness, in the service of his country.” In a similar vein, former president, Goodluck Jonathan has also sent a condolence message to the president and Kyari’s family. He said, “I condole with His Excellency, President Buhari, the Kyari family and all sympathisers on the demise of Mallam Abba Kyari who until his death was the Chief of Staff to the President of Nigeria. May Allah grant him Al Jannah Firdaus and strengthen his family & friends during this moment of grief.”
