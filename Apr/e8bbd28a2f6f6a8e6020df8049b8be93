The Federal Road Safety Corps, in a coordinated operation, has arrested and booked a total of 321 offenders for overloading their vehicles with passengers and violating the federal government’s social distance order put in place by the federal government to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Bisi Kazeem, the Corps Public Education Officer, in a statement on Tuesday said the arrests were effected between Sunday, March 30, and April 6, 2020 owing to the Presidential directive on strict adherence to social distancing order. Kazeem said, “Generally, so far within the first week of this enforcement, the Corps has recorded 321 arrests on overloading and violation of the social distance directive. “The Corps Marshal has further called on motorists to desist from any act of overloading of vehicles and warned passengers not to board any vehicle that is already carrying more than the expected number of persons.” He further quoted the Corp marshal, Dr. Boboye Oyeyemi as saying that, “Everybody must be at alert and maintain maximum health and safety guidelines as any compromise might be so dangerous and could lead to undue escalation of the already rising pandemic”.
