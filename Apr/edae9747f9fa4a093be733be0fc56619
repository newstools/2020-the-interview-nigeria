The United States (US) President, Donald Trump, has said that the US has recorded up to one million cases of COVID-19 because it does the best test in the world. Trump, who made this claim on his official twitter page on Wednesday, said the COVID-19 test conducted in the US was superior to what other countries do. “The only reason the U.S. has reported one million cases of CoronaVirus is that our Testing is so much better than any other country in the World,” Trump said. He added that other countries were way behind the US in testing for the virus. Trump said, “Other countries are way behind us in Testing, and therefore show far fewer cases!”. US, according to Worldometer, has reported over one million Coronavirus cases, with over 140,000 recoveries and about 60,000 deaths.
