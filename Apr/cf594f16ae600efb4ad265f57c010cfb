The leadership of the National Assembly says there should be more coordination in the management of donations received from individuals and organisations for the fight against COVID-19. The Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, made the call on Tuesday, when he spoke State House Correspondents, after meeting behind closed doors with President Muhammadu Buhari. Lawan was accompanied by the Speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila. He said, “The leadership of the National Assembly has been holding series of meetings with Ministers and the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and this afternoon we had an engagement with the President to discuss with him what we have resolved as leaders of the National Assembly and our opinion on various issues regarding the fight against COVID-19 in Nigeria as well as going forward. “For example, the various donations that we are receiving should go into a single account and should have a fund management committee that would be in charge of releases. Accountability and transparency require that we have that separation. “It is also an opportunity for us to commend Nigerians and corporate bodies that have given us donations but we believe there should be more coordination as far as the management of the funds donated is concerned.” Lawan used the opportunity to commend the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 for working hard to address the challenge confronting the nation. “I believe the Presidential Task Force is doing a very good job, they have been very proactive and they deserve our commendation,” he said.
