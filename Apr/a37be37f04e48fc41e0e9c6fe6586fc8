A former governor of Kano State, Rabiu Kwankwaso, has donated a 60-bed medical facility, Amana hospital, to the state government to help in the fight against COVID-19. The state presently has 36 confirmed cases of the virus out of the 627 total in the country. It has also recorded one death. After Lagos and Abuja, it has the third highest number of recorded cases. Saifullahi Hassan, media aide to Kwankwaso, who reported the donation in a statement on Monday, said the contribution was to assist the “Management Committee overcome this epidemic.” Hassan said, “Amana Hospital is newly built, fully equipped with 60-bed capacity, completed last month and it has not yet been commissioned. It is located at Miller Road, Bompai, Kano State.” The state taskforce for COVID-19 is headed by the deputy governor,  Nasiru Gawuna.
