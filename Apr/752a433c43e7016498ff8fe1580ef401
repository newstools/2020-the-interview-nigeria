The Federal Government is set to evacuate Nigerians in the Diaspora as Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs begins compilation of Nigerians who wish to return to the country. This was made known in a statement signed by Abdur-Rahman Balogun, Head of Media and Public Relations at the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM). The statement said, “Sequel to requests by Nigerians stranded abroad in the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has directed all its missions abroad to compile lists of willing nationals who wanted to come back home.” The NIDCOM  Chairman/CEO,  Hon. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, however, noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had instructed that the financial implications would be borne by the prospective evacuees, who would be compulsorily quarantined when they return. Dabiri-Erewa urged Nigerians stranded abroad willing to return home to key into this Federal Government gesture by providing their information to the missions in their respective host countries.
