Mohammed Abubakar, one of the sons of a former Nigerian vice president, Atiku Abubakar, has recovered from COVID-19. Mohammed tested positive since March 22 and was subsequently moved to the Gwagwalada Specialist Hospital Abuja, where he has been receiving treatment. However, he announced on Monday that he had now tested negative, more than one month after he was admitted in the facility. He tweeted, “I have just received my second consecutive negative result.”
