The United Nations on Thursday received vital health supplies to support the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. The supplies, comprising 10,000 test kits, 15 oxygen concentrators, and various personal protective equipment (PPE), vaccines, IEHK/PEP kits, and other vital health supplies will support the government’s COVID-19 Response Plan and UNICEF’s work with children and families in Nigeria. The supplies will also support the federal government, through the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), to prevent and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in affected states across the country. According to a statement by Edward Kallon, the UN’s Resident Coordinator in Nigeria, the supplies are co-financed by the European Union (EU) and IHS Nigeria, the Nigerian subsidiary of IHS Towers. Additional COVID-19 response supplies, he noted, were expected in a UN joint flight to be delivered to Nigeria in the coming days. Kallon  stated, “The test kits will enable healthcare workers to test those who suspect they may have the virus to verify their health status, so they can get treatment and protect their families and communities. “We know that to limit the spread of the virus, it is important to test as many people as possible, especially those with recent travel history and those who came into contact with travelers. “These test kits will support Nigeria’s drive to control the transmission of COVID-19 infections and support the Government’s ongoing strong efforts to protect the country from an escalating pandemic.” He added, “Working closely together with the Government and other partners, including the private sector, is the surest way of preventing and containing the COVID-19 pandemic. We are grateful for the support of the EU and IHS in getting these vital supplies to strengthen the UN’s efforts in helping the Government of Nigeria to address the COVID-19 challenge.”
