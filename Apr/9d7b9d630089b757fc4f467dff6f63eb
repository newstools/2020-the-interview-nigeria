The Nigerian Minister of State for Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mr. Clem Agba, has assured the public that the fire incident at the office of the accountant-general of the federation on Wednesday did not destroy any financial records. The Federal Fire Service extinguished the fire that engulfed parts of the Treasury House district of Abuja, which serves as the office of the Accountant General of the Federation in the Garki district of the Federal Capital Territory. Agba told journalists that he had inspected the affected offices in the building, and that all government’s financial transactions records were intact. But he also noted that they had not taken an inventory of all that was destroyed in the fire. The Minister said, “We have gone round the rooms and offices where the fire affected, and I am glad to report that our data Centre where all our records are kept are fully intact,” he said. “There is no destruction, so we haven’t lost any record. As a government I want to assure you that our records are intact, a few documents are burnt, we haven’t started recovery to check what actually burnt, but all our financial transactions are intact. “We would be doing a full scale investigation using the right professionals to determine exactly what happened.” Agba also disclosed the incident, which was said to have started about 11am, was caused by a spark in one of the air conditioners on the fourth floor of the building. The office is located next door to the FCT Police Command.
