The Kano state ministry of health has confirmed the deaths of two people due to the COVID-19. This makes it three COVID-19 deaths that have been officially reported in the state so far. The state has experienced a series of unexplained deaths in the last few days with some of the deceased showing symptoms of COVID-19 hours before dying. Activities of the state task force on COVID-19 and ministry of health have also been grounded after some key officials tested positive for the virus. Testing in state had been halted during that period. The health ministry after three days of silence on its Twitter handle announced the deaths on Monday. The tweet read, “As at 12:15pm, 27th, April, 2020, Kano State has recorded an additional 2 deaths of COVID-19.” Kano has a total of 77 confirmed cases of the Coronavirus.
