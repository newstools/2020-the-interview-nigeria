The Kaduna State first lady, Hajia Hadiza el-Rufai has apologised for the tweet of her son, Bello, who threatened gang-rape for the mother of a twitter user. She also apologised for her initial reaction when twitter users called her attention to Bello’s distasteful tweets. She said, “Never ever should sexual abuse be employed as ammunition in public/ private exchanges, no matter the provocation, she said. “I can see how my tweet may have come across, and I apologise to those who were offended by it. I say, once again, that I’d never condone sexual abuse in any shape or form.” Bello, one of the sons of Kaduna State governor, had on Sunday told a twitter user, “Tell your mother I’m passing her to my friends tonight. No Igbo sounds please!”. However, when the first lady’s attention was drawn to her son’s statement on Sunday, she said had tweeted, “All you people talking about @B_ELRUFAI Don’t @ me. Sow the wind, reap the whirlwind. All is fair in love and war. My belief: Respect everyone, but take no shit from anyone. I didn’t see any threats of rape. I would never condone that.” Mrs. el-Rufai, in explaining her initial response, said she had not seen the gang-rape threat tweet before responding and that she had also spoken to her son over the controversial tweet. “When I posted the tweet below, I assumed it was just the usual Twitter gbas-gbos. Having read the tweets chronologically, I have had conversations with Bello,” she stated.
