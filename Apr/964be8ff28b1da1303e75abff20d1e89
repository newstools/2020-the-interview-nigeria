Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to President Buhari, Mr. Femi Adesina, has disclosed that he saw late chief of staff to the president Abba Kyari in a dream a day before he died. In a tribute in honour of Kyari, who died of complications from COVID-19 a week ago, Adesina narrated how he saw Kyari in a dream but he never took the dream seriously. He said, “I’m not much of a dreamer. At least, not dreams with significance. Dreams come from a multitude of business, as the Good Book says, so if a man drinks a bowl of garri before going to bed, and he dreams of swimming in a pond or river, he actually started swimming right from inside that bowl of garri. “On Thursday night inward Friday, I dreamt. The President and myself were in a corridor in the Presidential Villa, and he was talking with me. Suddenly, by my right, I saw a figure waiting for me to finish with the President. “It was Mallam Abba, clad in his usual white native attire, with the trademark red cap. But this time, there was no flowing Agbada, which I found rather odd. He never (or rarely) appeared without the flowing robe. “He was heavily bearded, another surprise, and the beard was all white. I rounded off discussion with the President, and yielded space for the Chief.” Adesina further said he made nothing out of the dream until a friend interpreted the dream to him after Kyaru’s death. He said, “I shared my experience with my friend, Mallam Garba Deen Mohammed. “He came to say goodbye to you, and you didn’t know it,” my friend said. I didn’t know till then that Garba Deen had the uncommon gift of interpretation of dreams. Well, I now know where to go the next time I dream.”
