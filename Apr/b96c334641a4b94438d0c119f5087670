Shiekh Abdullahi Bala Lau, the National leader of an Islamic pressure group in Nigeria, Jama’atul Izalatul Bid’ah WaIqamatus Sunnah (JIBWIS), has commiserated with Nigeria and President Muhammadu Buhari over the death of his Chief of Staff, Mallam Abba Kyari. Bala Lau said the organisation received the news of Abba Kyari’s death “with great sorrow and deep regret.” While commiserating with his family, the presidency and the entire nation, the national chairman of JIBWIS prayed Allah to overlook Kyari’s shortcomings as human and grant him eternal bliss in paradise. Bala Lau described the death of Abba Kyari as “a huge loss’’ but also said that, “Its a reminder that every soul shall taste death when their stipulated time comes.” He enjoined Nigerian leaders and politicians to always remember that the present world was transient which required God’s consciousness and humane attitude towards all mortals. “This is a lesson to all leaders and every Nigerian that while we are alive, we should give all we can to aid development and support the cause of humanity. While on earth, Kyari gave his own best and we pray to Allah to forgive his shortcomings. “Sadly, his exit came at a time when the world is reeling under unprecedented challenges and at a time when his counsel is most needed. “Clearly, such grave loss will be deeply felt by President Muhammadu Buhari and we should pray that God Almighty grant Mr. President and Malam Kyari’s family the strength to bear this irreparable loss,” he stated. Bala Lau also urged Nigerians to abide by government’s directives regarding the containment of COVID-19, while maintaining social distance among other precautions.
