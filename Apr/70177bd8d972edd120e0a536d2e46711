Katsina State government has ordered a total lockdown of Daura Local government after three new cases of COVID-19 were recorded. Katsina State governor, Aminu Masari, made this announcement in a series of tweets on Friday. The governor disclosed that the three new cases were the wife and two children of a medical doctor, Aliyu Yakubu, who died as a result of COVID-19 few days after retuning from Lagos to Daura. Masari said, “Further to our earlier briefing on the Daura #COVID19 situation; out of the samples sent for testing, 23 results have been returned with 20 being negative while 3 are unfortunately positive. Incidentally the 3 are the deceased Doctor’s wife and his 2 children. “Though identification and taking of samples is still ongoing in Daura, the state Government has decided to put Daura under a total lockdown starting from 7am tomorrow. We gave this grace to enable people make necessary purchases. Masari said the state government would provide palliative to cushion the effect of the lockdown on residents of the local government and the government would not hesitate to shut the entire state down if need be. “We will continue to monitor situations as they unfold and will not hesitate to lockdown any local government area that may record positive #COVID19 case. We won’t falter in putting the whole state under total lockdown should the situation warrants, he said.
