The federal government on Friday said that no decision had been taken to provide two months free electricity for Nigerians. Speaker of the House of Representatives, Honourable Femi Gbajabiamila, had said that the National Assembly was working with the ministry of finance for a bill that would provide Nigerians free electricity for two months to cushion the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown. However, contrary to Gbajabiamila’s report, the ministry of power on Friday said there was no plan to provide two months free electricity for Nigerians in a tweet. The ministry tweeted, “Please Note: NO DECISION has been taken by the Federal Government to provide Nigerians with FREE ELECTRICITY for two months,” The ministry further stated that if such decision was taken to provide Nigerians free electricity it would be announced officially. “If and when that becomes a reality, it shall be announced officially. Be rest assured that FG is exploring ways to ameliorate any hardship on Nigerians”, the ministry said.
