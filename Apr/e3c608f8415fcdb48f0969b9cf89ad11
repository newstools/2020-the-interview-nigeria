The Kano State governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has said his government is doing autopsies to ascertain the cause of mysterious deaths in the state. Ganduje, who made this known in a series of tweets on Monday, also announced that the state was partnering with Bayero University Kano to set up another COVID-19 test centre. He said, “Over the past week there have been reports of mysterious deaths in our great Kano State and I’m here to assure everyone that investigations are already ongoing. Autopsies are still being carried out but so far there’s been nothing to suggest that they are linked with #COVID-19. “The State Ministry of Health have been sleepless in their battle against the pandemic and I will like to commend them for their efforts thus far. They have fought hard in the sporadic testing and quarantining of infected person across the state. “To ease their burden a bit, we are currently partnering with Bayero University Kano to set up an additional Covid-19 test centre in the State.” Ganduje urged the people of Kano to abide by the lockdown order and observe social distancing. “I beckon the people of Kano to help us in this fight against the pandemic by respecting the lockdown, maintaining social distancing and washing their hands regularly.  It is only together, that we have a chance at flattening the curve”, he said.
