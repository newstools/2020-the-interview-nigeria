President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled with the people and government of Plateau State over the passing of an illustrious son and highly decorated retired military officer, General Domkat Bali. The presidentâ€™s condolence message is contained in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja on Friday. Buhari, who spoke with the wife of the deceased, Esther on Friday, also commiserated with other family members, friends and professional associates of the former member of the Supreme Military Council and Armed Forces Ruling Council. He noted that Bali, after rising through the ranks, with a distinguished military career, reaching the peak as Chief of Defence Staff, served the country meritoriously as Minister of Defence. According to him, the records of bravery and patriotism of Bali, the Ponzhi Tarok, will continue to inspire young military officers, while the foundation he laid in all the commands he headed will always be remembered. Buhari prayed that the almighty God would receive the soul of the departed and comfort his family.
