Mahmood Yakubu was on Wednesday sworn in as the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for his second five-year term. The oath of office was administered by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House. Speaking to the media afterwards, Yakubu said the Commission was on track in making preparations for the 2023 general elections and would work with members of the National Assembly to an amended Electoral Act. He said, “We have clearly demonstrated in recent elections that elections are getting better and they will continue to get better. The National Assembly is holding a public hearing on the amendment of the electoral legal framework.” Yakubu said, “This is important and this time around, working with the National Assembly, we will ensure a speedy passage of the amendment bill and once it is assented to, it will help us enormously in confronting the challenges ahead. “Preparations for 2023 general elections have proceeded in earnest. We need certainty and therefore the electoral legal framework is fundamental, without which we cannot formulate our regulations and guidelines.” He said, “Without our regulations and guidelines, we cannot conclude work on the manual for the training of ad-hoc staff for the elections. So from here, I am going to proceed to the National Assembly, so work begins in earnest and we have already started.”
