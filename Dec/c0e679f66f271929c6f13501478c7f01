The Corps Marshal of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Dr Boboye Oyeyem, has expressed deep concerns on the rising rate of car accidents and has directed Commanding Officers to step up enforcement of the law on use of speed limiting device. This was disclosed by the Corps Public Education Officer, Assistant Corps Marshal Bisi Kazeem, in a press release issued in Abuja on Sunday. While the Corps Marshal expressed satisfaction with the conduct of most drivers and the performance of the personnel in containing the rate and fatalities of road traffic crashes within the period of Christmas celebration, he expressed concerns that the increasing level of speed induced crashes as recorded within the period is undermining the efforts of the Corps to ensure safer road environments, saying every steps must be taken to restore normalcy to the road. Kazeem said that, “while other causative factors such as route violation, dangerous driving and light sign violations were not completely ruled out in the records of crashes that occurred within the period, the reoccurring nature of speeding as a major factor was a source of deep concern to the Corps Marshal who has ordered for a review of the strategy for a more effective enforcement of the regulations on use of speed limiting device. “While warning the drivers to be cautious of the speed which has become a major causative factor in crash occurrences within the period under review, despite the massive public enlightenment campaigns launched by the Corps to sensitize members of the public on the menace of speed induced crashes, the Corps Marshal described the phenomenon as unacceptable. He added, “We must step up enforcement of the regulations on use of speed limiting device in the second phase of the special operations and first quarter of next year to drastically force down the growing trends of speed induced crashes. “Commanding Officers are hereby given special directives on aggressive enforcement of the regulations on the use of speed limiting device to curb the rate of crashes and fatalities that speeding causes, as shown by the records of the first phase of the special operations. “Consequently, those that are operating without speed limiters or those using faulty as well as those that have reset their own speed limiters to make them ineffective must not be spared to endanger other road users.”
