The Chairman of  People’s Democratic Party (PDP) of Yelli Ward, Kojoli, Jada LGA, Adamawa State, Philip Buji, is dead. Mr. Buji died early on Friday at Jada Cottage Hospital after a brief illness. A statement signed by PDP Publicity Secretary, Ibrahim Ahidjo Karlahi confirmed his death. Buji was arrested in April this year by the police on matters that were believed to be purely political. Along with three others, he was charged with terrorism. The charges were subsequently withdrawn. But the misunderstanding  ultimately led to the unceremonious redeployment of the state Police Commissioner, Mr. Madaki. Buji is survived by a wife and many children. Former Chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT), Abdulrasheed Maina, also a fugitive from justice, has appeared before a Federal High Court in Abuja, for the first time several months after jumping bail.
