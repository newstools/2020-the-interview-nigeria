The APC candidate in the Sept. 19 Governorship election in Edo, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, says he will not challenge the outcome of the election at the tribunal. Ize-Iyamu disclosed this in a statement signed by Mr. John Mayaki, his Director of Communication and Media Campaign Organisation on Monday in Benin. This was Ize-Iyamu’s first official statement since the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Mr. Godwin Obaseki of the PDP as winner of the election.

According to him, contrary to orchestrated media reports, the election was neither free nor fair. There were several episodes of violence, intimidation of voters and falsification of results. “In particular, there were unlawful cancellations of results, particularly from Urhonigbe South and North in Orhiomwon. “Results were falsified from many polling units in Ofunama in Ovia South-West, and in parts of Ovia North-East, Owan West, Oredo, Egor, Ikpoba-Okha, Esan North-East, Esan West, Esan South-East, and Uhunmwode Local Government areas. “Sadly, two persons were killed during the election, while gun-wielding thugs took over collation centres in many locations without the intervention of law-enforcement agents.

We have, however, decided not to commence an election petition. “This is to avoid further tension in the state. “We are also mindful that the leadership of our great party, APC and many well-placed individuals have made pronouncements endorsing the process, which we have chosen to respect,’’ Ize-Iyamu said. He said that they have consequently,  decided to continue with the pre-election cases in full exercise of “our legal rights, just as our opponents have considered it their prerogative to also continue with their pre-election cases against us’’. Ize-Iyamu thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for his statesmanship and support throughout the election campaign.
