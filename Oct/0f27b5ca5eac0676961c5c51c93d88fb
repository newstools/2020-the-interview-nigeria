President Muhammadu Buhari is set to address the natyion by 7pm today(Thurday). The address is coming after calls from diffrent quarters for the president to address Nigerians over the Tuesday night shooting of #EndSARS protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate, Lagos. The Presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina said in a statement on Thursday that Buhari would make the address, “following detailed briefing by security chiefs on the current situation in the country,”. He added, “Television, radio and other electronic media outlets are enjoined to hook up to the network services of the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) and Radio Nigeria respectively for the broadcast.” Inmates at Ikoyi Correctional Centre have attempted to break out of the facility but faced resistance from the Nigeria Police and soldiers who were mobilised to the scene. Inmates reportedly set parts of the facility on fire in the attempted jailbreak. The Police Public Relations Officer, Lagos State, Mr. Muyiwa Adejobi, said the cause of the fire could not yet be ascertained but policemen had been deployed in the prisons. “We don’t know the cause of the fire but we are there on the ground. We have mobilised to the place. We will give details later,” he said. A video posted on twitter shows smoke from the prison, and unusual level of activity with police and soldiers later arriving at the prison.
