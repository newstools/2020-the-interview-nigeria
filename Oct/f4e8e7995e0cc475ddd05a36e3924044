Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano state has suspended his Special Adviser on Media, Salihu Yakasai disparaging President Muhammadu Buhari on social media. The state commissioner for Information, Muhammad Garba, said in a statement on Sunday that the suspension was with immediate effect. Garba said though the media aide owned up to making the indiscreet comment and described it as his personal opinion,  it will be difficult to differentiate between personal opinion and official stand on matters of public concern. Garba said, “The governor therefore warned political appointees and public servants to guard against making statements capable of drawing unnecessary controversy and heating up the polity.” He reaffirmed the commitment of Governor Ganduje to the policies and programmes of President Buhari’s administration.
