Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has imposed a 24-hour curfew begining from 4pm on Tuesday, in the state following nearly two weeks of protests against police brutality. The governor said in a statement that the protests, which started off peacefully was now threat to society. He said, “I have watched with shock how what began as a peaceful #EndSARS protest has degenerated into a monster that is threatening the well-being of our society. “Lives and limbs have been lost as criminals and miscreants are now hiding under the umbrella of these protests to unleash mayhem on our State.” Sanwo-Olu added, “As a government that is alive to its responsibility and has shown a commitment to the movement #ENDSARS, we will not watch and allow anarchy in our dear state. “I, therefore, hereby impose a 24-hour curfew on all parts of the State as from 4pm today, 20th October,2020. Nobody, except essential service providers and first responders must be found on the streets.” Lagos is now the second state to impose a state-wide curfew. A day earlier, a curfew had also been imposed in Edo after hoodlums stormed a prison facility and freed the inmates.
