President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, says the Senate is committed to pursuing the dreams of the late Senator Rose Oko especially on her quest for development of education in Nigeria. Lawan said this in an interview with journalists in Abuja on Tuesday, shortly after signing the condolence register at the valedictory section in honour of the late senator, who died on March 23. Lawan, who described the passage of the senator as a very painful loss, however, said her achievements in education and public service were impactful. “Those issues that she dreamt about, issues of education for our children particularly, national unity and national development are issues we will continue to focus on in the Senate.

If it means taking out two million or three million per year out of the streets, we are under obligations to do so as a country. “Education must be a right because you cannot get the best out of your people, if you do not educate them. Because, at the end of the day you will be lost, the country will be the worse for it; so we must give these children education and give people the opportunity to render their potential.” Lawan also said the life and attributes and achievements of the late Senator Oko signified national unity, hence the need for all Nigerians to be united to develop the nation. “We need to be united in this country; we have no reason to be fighting each other on the basis of ethnic or religious backgrounds in this country. “Nigeria is a country that has come to stay; what we need to do is to continuously look into the best ways possible of ensuring that we provide avenues to improve on governance.

As politicians, we need to come together and provide leadership that will bring people together. ]“Whenever you have been given the mandate, try to help to build the country because there is need to have a country before you can become anything. “And you need to have people to be given the services they need, the education they need the health they need, then you have something to build your country on. If we continue to just fight on the basis of political parties or ethnic background, or religious persuasion, Nigeria will not make progress and that will be unfortunate.” (NAN)
