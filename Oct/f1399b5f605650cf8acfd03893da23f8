The Speaker of Edo State House of Assembly, Francis Okiye, has been impeached by his colleagues. Marcus Onobun, representing Esan-west constituency, was elected as the speaker of the state assembly. Okiye removal on Monday was based on allegations of high-handedness. It followed a motion by Henry Okhurobo, house majority leader, and seconded by Yekini Idaiye, lawmaker representing Akoko-Edo I. Nine of 10 members of the assembly signed the impeachment letter at the plenary session on Monday.
