Former United States Secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton, has told President Muhammadu and the Nigerian Army to stop the killing of unarmed #EndSARS protesters in the country. Mrs. Clinton was reacting to the massacre of young Nigerians who were, on Tuesday Night, gunned down in cold blood at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos State, by Nigerian security operatives for protesting against police brutality in the country. Her tweet read, “I’m calling on @mbuhari (President Muhammadu Buhari) and the @hqnigerianarmy (Nigeria Army) to stop killing young #EndSARS protesters. “#StopNigeriaGovernment.” Recall that Nigerian security agents had opened fire on the youths who were protesting peacefully. The shooting forced many of the protesters to run for their lives, with witnesses capturing some of the shooting on video. Videos posted on social media also show casualties from the shootings though there is no verifiable number of those killed from shootings or suffered injury at this time.
