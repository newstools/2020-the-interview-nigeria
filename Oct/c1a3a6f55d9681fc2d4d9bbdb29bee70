EndSARS protesters held their Sunday service in front of the Lagos government house with Leke Adeboye, son of the general overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, joining and leading the service. The protesters who have been on the streets for more than a week now have been demanding an end to police brutality. Adeboye, leading the service said, “I want all of us to know that this nation has been handed over to us slowly but surely by this singular move that we are all here representing our families, friends and nation. This is the beginning of the new Nigeria.” He said, “Father, please touch my nation! Please touch our leaders! Please touch me! “Oh Lord! Touch this nation. Touch our leaders, touch their hearts, touch their ears, touch their brains so that this nation can be greater and become nation that we want in Jesus name.” The number of active cases of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria have dropped to 3,627 cases according to the latest numbers from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.
