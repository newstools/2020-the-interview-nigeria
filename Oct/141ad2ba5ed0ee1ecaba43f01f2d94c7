Inmates at Ikoyi Correctional Centre have attempted to break out of the facility but faced resistance from the Nigeria Police and soldiers who were mobilised to the scene. Inmates reportedly set parts of the facility on fire in the attempted jailbreak. The Police Public Relations Officer, Lagos State, Mr. Muyiwa Adejobi, said the cause of the fire could not yet be ascertained but policemen had been deployed in the prisons. “We don’t know the cause of the fire but we are there on the ground. We have mobilised to the place. We will give details later,” he said. A video posted on twitter shows smoke from the prison, and unusual level of activity with police and soldiers later arriving at the prison.
