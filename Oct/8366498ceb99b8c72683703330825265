President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday gave former Minister of Finance, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Nigeria’s total backing to emerge as the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation. He said the reason wasn’t because the former Managing Director (Operations) of the World Bank was a Nigerian, but because she deserved to occupy the position by merit. The former minister had visited Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, where they held a meeting. “I assure you that we will do all that we can to ensure that you emerge as the Director-General of WTO, not only because you are a Nigerian, but because you are a hard-working Nigerian.

You are both highly qualified. We will continue to support you. I will immediately make those calls”, he added. The former minister is one of two final leading contenders for the plum position. Okonjo-Iweala and South Korea’s Yoo Myung-hee had scaled the hurdles to the final stage of the selection process on October 7, 2020. Okonjo-Iweala had visited Buhari in company with the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo, and the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Zubair Dada.
