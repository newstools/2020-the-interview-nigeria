The twitter account of National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) has reportedly been hacked by international ‘hacktivist’ group “Anonymous”. The twitter account, which the group has also taken over is now being used to messages supporting #EndSARS protests. The protests have been ongoing for a week now demanding an end to police brutality, specifically from the now rested Special Anti-Robbery Squad. The group  tweeted: “We #Anonymous are out to expose government’s secrets & dirty files Put an #ENDTOPOLICEBRUTALITY #Twitterdown. “Good morning, great Nigerians. TGIF and it’s also a good day to #ENDSARS and #EndSWAT. Which government website(s) would you want us to play with? Drop your suggestions under this tweet. #TwitterDown #NBChacked.”
