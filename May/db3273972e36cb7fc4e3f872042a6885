The Nigwria government has thrown its weight behind embattled African Development Bank (AfDB)’s president, Akinwumi Adesina, saying US call for independent investigation of Adesina be ignored. The US has called for an independent investigation of Adesina, who was  allegedly accused of favoritism by a whistleblower. However, in a letter by the minister of finance, budget and national planning, Zainab Ahmed, the federal government urged the board of the AfDB to ignore calls for an independent investigation of Adesina by the US. Ahmed urged Kaba Niale, chairman of the AfDB board of governors, to follow laid down processes to protect and preserve the bank. “The call for an independent investigation of the president is outside of the laid down rules, procedures and governing system of the bank and its articles as it relates to the code of conduct on ethics for the president,” Ahmed wrote. She further noted that a bank should respect the rule of law and if there are need for improvement, it should be done according to laid down procedure. Ahmed said, “As a bank we must uphold the rule of law and respect the governance systems of the bank. If there is any governance issue that needs improvement, there can be considered and amendment proposed for adoption in line with laid down procedure.”
