The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Friday handed over a property forfeited by former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Allison-Madueke to the Lagos State government to use as an isolation centre for COVID-19 patients. The anti-graft agency announced this in a statement shared on its Twitter page on Friday. The property containing six units of three-bedroom apartment and service quarters, was forfeited by Mrs. Allison-Madueke following an order of Lagos State Federal High Court in 2017. The EFCC also urged Lagos state government not to hesitate to call on the Commission anytime the need for such essential service arises. “In addition to our mandate to fight economic and financial crimes, the Commission is committed and ready to render essential services that may be required of it in the fight against COVID-19,” the anti-graft agency said. Speaking during the handover ceremony, the Lagos Zonal Head of the EFCC, Mohammed Rabo, stated that the gesture was part of the Commission’s social responsibility efforts towards the fight against the spread of COVID-19.
