Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State on Thursday ordered the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) officials visiting the state on national assignment to be isolated for two weeks, in accordance with the World Health Organisation (WHO)’s guidelines. The governor gave the order when the team visited him at government house in Lokoja and presented their letter of assignment. The NCDC officials were in Kogi to confirm the state’s COVID-19 status and readiness to tackle the pandemic. However, Bello accused the visiting team of sharing microphone and handshake with his state’s officials, thereby violating the established guidelines. He stated, “The DG protocol was interacting with us just now and he exchanged mic and handshake with you, the team lead, which is against the NCDC protocol. So you will observe the protocol of going into isolation, the team, together with the DG protocol. “We are going to collect every one of you samples and send them for tests to ensure that you are COVID-19 free. “After 14 days in our isolation centre, if nothing happens then you are free to continue your job.”
