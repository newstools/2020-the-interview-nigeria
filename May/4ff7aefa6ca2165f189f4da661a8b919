He expressed his concern about the spate of ethnic conflicts that has resurfaced in some parts of Northern Nigeria in recent times. He advised Nigerians to see themselves as a single entity and thus learn to tolerate one another despite their ethnic and religious differences. Aregbesola further assured Nigerians that President Muhammadu Buhariâ€™s administration was fully committed to battling the scourge of COVID-19 with the cooperation of everyone. He advised Nigerians to take responsibility against the spread of COVID-19 by observing physical and social distancing, personal and respiratory hygiene, as well as other regulations issued by relevant authorities.
