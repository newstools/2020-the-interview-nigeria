The Adamawa State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) began the distribution of COVID-19 palliatives to 15,000 households, alongside a public awareness campaign on preventive measures against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the 21 local government areas of the state. Launching the campaign in Fufore, Girei and Yola North, the state Chairman of the party, Mr. Ibrahim Bilal, explained that it was critical that corporate entities and individuals replicate such efforts towards reducing the hardship people are facing as a result of the pandemic, and to educate locals with safety measures on COVID-19. Bilal said, “Hunger has no tribe, religion or political affiliation. That is why we are launching this campaign to support our people across the state irrespective of religion, ethnicity and party divide. “We are giving these materials to those that are most in need of them, not to our party members.” The party Chairman charged residents to observe every necessary safety protocol in order to stop the spread of the disease in the state, including washing of hands regularly, using face masks in public and maintaining social distance. Also speaking at the event, the APC secretary in the state, Mr. Wafari Theman said, “We are here to distribute some staple food like rice, noodles, among other food items to our people in Adamawa State. “The essence is to reach out to those particularly in need and to support families in the best way we can and is designed to reach out to 15,000 households.” One of the beneficiaries and a representative of the physically challenged groups, Mallam Abdullahi, commended the party for the gesture. “This help is timely and it would go a long way in addressing our problems and help our families too. I wish that other bodies and organisations would learn from this and come to our help,” he said.
