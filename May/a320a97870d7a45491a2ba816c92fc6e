Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri of Adamawa State on Thursday eased the restriction on Worship places and social gatherings earlier imposed on the state following the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. The governor in a statement by his Press Secretary, Humwashi Wonosikou, announced that Churches, Mosques and even the international Cattle Market which have been under lockdown could now reopen. However, he also warned that they must ensure social distancing with no more than 50 people at a time. Other measures include provision of hand sanitizers or washing of hands and temperature checks at the point of entry. The governor said that “Government now believes the contagion rate is low enough to justify a cautious easing of the restriction”, but warned that citizens must work extra hard on personal hygiene and strict adherence to laid down guidelines. Fintiri said the easing of the lockdown came as the state discharged five from its isolation center after testing negative of the virus. In the meantime, the 8pm to 6am curfew will remain in place until further notice.
