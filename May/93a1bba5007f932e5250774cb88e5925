Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri of Adamawa State has warned political office holders to desist from diverting palliatives meant for vulnerable people as the state plans to commence distribution of the next batch. The Governor gave the warning on Monday in the Government House, Yola during a meeting with Commissioners, members of the State Assembly and chairmen of local government councils who are members of the state Distribution Committee of palliatives. Fintiri frowned at how the first tranche of palliatives were distributed in the state noting that it was fraught with irregularities and diversion by some committee members. He warned that they should do away all political considerations in the subsequent distribution. “We should not use political considerations in governing the state at the detriment of Adamawa people,” the governor stressed. He called on members of the distribution committee especially political office holders to be serious. He added, “You should  find time on Thursday this week to collect the next batch of palliatives and follow it down to their various local governments for onward fair disbursement to vulnerable in the state.”
