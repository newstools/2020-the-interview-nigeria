President Muhammadu Buhari has received the Madagascar-made COVID-19 herbal remedy, known as COVID Organics. This was disclosed by the President’s Personal Assistant on New Media, Ahmad Bashir, in a tweet on Saturday. According to Ahmad, president Buhari said the Madagascar herbal remedy would be subjected to test before it can be used. “President @MBuhari has received the Madagascan native formulation against the COVID–19 pandemic, and reiterated that he will listen to science before allowing traditional or any new medicines to be administered on Nigerians”, Ahmad said. You will recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had on Monday ordered the importation of the made-in-Madagascar COVID-19 herbal cure for use in Nigeria.
