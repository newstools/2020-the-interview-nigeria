Kano State government has pardoned 300 inmates in a bid to de-congest correctional facilities in the state. The state governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, who made this known in a tweet on Sunday said the gesture was in line with the federal government’s policy to de-congest correctional facilities to avoid the outbreak of COVID-19 among inmates. He said, “In line with the Federal Government’s directive to decongest prisons, I visited the Goron Dutse Correctional Facility with @DGawuna.” Ganduje said the 300 inmates released where those with minimal charges and that the state government had paid their fines. “300 inmates on lesser charges were freed with their fines paid up by the state. The idea is to reduce the population to avoid a viral outbreaks, he said. The federal government had in April ordered that some inmates be pardoned to de-congest correctional facilities across the country in order to curb spread of COVID-19 among inmates.
