The Nigerian Government on Tuesday said that the COVID-19 Organics produced by Madagascar would be subjected to evaluation and certified safe by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) before being distributed for use in Nigeria. Dr. Sani Aliyu, the National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, stated this during the PTF daily briefing in Abuja on Tuesday. He said, “I want to start briefly with the Madagascar cure because it has been in the press recently. “As directed by Mr. President, I want to state again that any medication coming into the country whether it’s herbal cure or concoction or normal drug has to be subjected to the regulatory process. Dr. Aliyu added that no drug or vaccine could be used or distributed in the country without the certification of the NAFDAC. He said, “The Madagascar cure will be subjected to the regulatory process and guidelines that we have, not only to establish the drug efficacy but also drug safety. “As stated by NAFDAC, no drug can be manufactured, imported, exported, advertised, sold or distributed in the country unless legally registered. “So, this drug will go through the normal process which will be quite stringent before it can be administered to anybody within the country.”
