President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with Kano State Government and Council of Chiefs over demise of Emir of Rano, Alhaji Tafida Abubakar Ila Auta Bawo. The Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the President, Garba Shehu, made this known in a statement on Sunday. The statement reads, “The President joins the family and Rano Emirate in mourning the royal father, whose words of wisdom, nobility and decency will be sorely missed, especially at a time the government is relying on traditional rulers to sensitise citizens on directives for safety. “President Buhari urges his family and the Emirate to find solace in the good works of the deceased and ensure his legacies are carried on.” The 74 years old emir died after a brief undisclosed illness at Nasarawa Specialist Hospital, Kano on Saturday.
