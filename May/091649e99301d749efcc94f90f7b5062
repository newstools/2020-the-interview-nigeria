The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has said, once again, that  the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami, was not involved in the decision to evict or offer office space to the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM) at the NCC’s Communications and Digital Economy Complex located at Mbora District, Abuja. This, NCC said, was contrary to what the public is being made to believe. The director public affairs at the commission, Dr. Henry Nkemadu, made the clarification in a statement on Friday. According to the Nkemadu, Pantami was never involved in the offer of the office space, nor in the withdrawal of the offer for same office space. The Minister, he said, should not be brought into the issue. Nkemadu said the decision to withdraw the offer of office space from NIDCOM was purely that of the NCC, the custodian of the office complex. He said, “It should, however, be made abundantly clear that the withdrawal of the offer of the office space, which was unconditionally given, in the first instance, to NiDCOM, was informed by exigencies and change in priorities within the NCC, which led to the taking back of the office space earlier allocated with intention of finding a suitable replacement for NiDCOM.” The Commission reiterates its confidence in the leadership, person and office of the minister, Nkemadu added.
