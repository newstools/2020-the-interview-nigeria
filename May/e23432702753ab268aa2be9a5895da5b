President Donald Trump of the united States Of America (US) has accused social media of interfering with the 2020 US Presidential Election, adding that he would shut it (Social Media) down before letting that happen. Trump made this statement via his official Twitter handle on Wednesday, following Twitter’s response that highlighted two of Trump’s Tuesday tweets that falsely claimed mail-in ballots would lead to widespread voter fraud. Twitter had appended a link to Trump’s tweets, saying “Get the facts about mail-in ballots” to guide users to a Twitter “moments” page with fact checks. Outraged by Twitter’s response, Trump accused Twitter of completely stifling free speech. “@Twitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election. They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post. Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!” Trump added, “Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. “We can’t let a more sophisticated version of that happen again. Just like we can’t let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country. It would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots. Whoever cheated the most would win. Likewise, Social Media. Clean up your act, NOW!!!
