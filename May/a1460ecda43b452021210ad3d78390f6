The Nigeria Governors’ Forum will meet on Wednesday to take a stand on the executive order recently signed by President Muhammadu Buhari, giving financial autonomy to the  judiciary and legislature at the state level. Governors have in the past frustrated efforts by the National Assembly to grant financial autonomy to state houses of assembly. Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, Head of Media and Public Affairs at the  NGF secretariat in a statement on Tuesday said the consultation would be the ninth in the series of teleconference meetings held by the governors since the lockdown due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Barkindo,“Among the issues to be reviewed are a number of critical national questions that revolve around the financial autonomy for the states’ judiciary and legislature code-named the Executive Order 10, 2020.” He said, “The governors will also touch issues around the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) ownership, the controversial Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Bill. “Also to be discussed is the restructuring of states’ loans and the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) deductions,which have been a recurring decimal on the governors’ table. Barkindo said, “As usual the governors will be given an update on the COVID-19 pandemic in the country, as well as review a letter from the National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 as it relates to the pandemic draft regulations.”
