A former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for appointing Professor Ibrahim Gambari as his new Chief of Staff. He described the new chief of staff as a great asset to Nigeria and Africa. Ki-Moon wrote a letter of congratulations to Gambari, a former Nigerian Permanent Representative to the UN. In a letter he wrote dated May 18, 2020, Ki-Moon said, ”I would like to sincerely congratulate you on your recent appointment as Chief of Staff to H.E. President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria. “Your appointment is a great asset not to the President of Nigeria but also your country Nigeria and Africa in a broader sense. “I am confident that your invaluable experience gained while serving the UN, with various important leadership roles, will help your leadership in addressing these challenging times caused by COVID-19. “I shared this good news with the former Minister Yoo Chong-ha, your good friend and former Foreign Minister of Korea. He sends his warmest congratulations to you.” Ki-Moon said he looked forward to meeting Gambari again. He wished Gambari well in his new role as presidential gate keeper. Gambari replaced the late Abba Kyari, who died on April 17 from COVID-19 complications.
