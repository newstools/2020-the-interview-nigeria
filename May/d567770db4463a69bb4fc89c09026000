The Presidency has debunked reports that President Muhammadu Buhari cancelled appointments and memos signed off by his former Chief of Staff, Mallam Abba Kyari. Some newspapers had reported that Kyari, who died on April 17 from COVID-19 complications made some appointments without President Buhari’s approval and that the president was probing and cancelling those appointments. However, in a statement on Tuesday, Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the president on Media and Publicity, urged the public to disregard such reports. “The attention of the Presidency has been drawn to media reports alleging that President Muhammadu Buhari has cancelled a number of memos and appointments signed off by his former Chief of Staff. “Not surprisingly, these reports have quoted unnamed sources. There is not a grain of truth in these reports and Nigerians should please ignore the insinuations behind them”, he said. Shehu said that President Buhari as a democratically elected president would never cede his power to sign off appointments to anyone. “President Buhari was duly re-elected by Nigerians in February 2019. He has not and will never cede to anyone else, that power and trust given to him by the Nigerian people”, Shehu said.
