President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the importation of the made-in-Madagascar COVID-19 herbal cure for use in Nigeria. Mr. Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of Federation (SGF) and Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 announced this during a briefing in Abuja on Monday. Mustapha said President Buhari had given instruction for the importation of the herbal remedy from Madagascar and that efforts were ongoing to get it. He said, “Mr. President has given instructions for the airlifting of Nigeria’s allocation of the Madagascar COVID-19 Syrup; also given clear instructions that it must be subjected to the standard validation process for pharmaceuticals; there will be no exceptions for this.” Mustapha added that the herbal cure would be subjected to further tests when it gets to Nigeria. “Madagascar has made allocations to various countries and sent them to Guinea Bissau. We‘re supposed to make arrangements to freight Nigeria’s allocation from Guinea Bissau; it‘ll be subjected to the standard validation process for pharmaceuticals”, he said.
