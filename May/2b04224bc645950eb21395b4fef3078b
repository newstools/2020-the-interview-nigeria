The Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to President Buhari, Mr. Femi Adesina, has said that the fact that Nigerians elected President Muhammadu Buhari didn’t empower them to also order the President around. Mr. Adesina made this statement while responding to a question from a caller on the Nigeria Info FM. Ask by a caller who identified himself as Mr. Ibikunle, when  President Buhari would have a media chat with the Nigerian media on COVID-19, Adesina said Buhari had done three national broadcast and wondered what else Nigerians wanted. “I just want to encourage Mr. Ibikunle not to continue to sound like a broken record. When the COVID thing started, everyone wanted the President to talk to us. “He has had three National broadcasts within a month. What else do they want? What else do they want? Some people think because you elected a President or you did not elect you, you must lead your President by the nose“. The presidential spokesman said the president would do what is good and right and did not need to be ordered around by citizens on what to do. “It doesn’t happen. The fact that you have elected a man does not mean then you begin to order him around. The President will do what is good for the country at any given time” he noted.
