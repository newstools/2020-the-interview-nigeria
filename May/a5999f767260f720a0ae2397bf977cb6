He said, “I will be lowering the flags on all Federal Buildings and National Monuments to half-staff over the next three days in memory of the Americans we have lost to the CoronaVirus”. He also noted that the lowering of flags on Monday would be in honour of Americans in the Military, who died serving their country. “On Monday, the flags will be at half-staff in honor of the men and women in our Military who have made the Ultimate Sacrifice for our Nation,” Trump said.
