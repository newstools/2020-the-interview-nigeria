Katsina State Government has closed down the Emir of Daura’s palace in an effort to contain the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The state govenor, Aminu Masari, said a number of people had tested positive in the palace, while 89 samples had been taken to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for testing. In the last few days, emirs in two neighbouring states have died in circumstances suspected to be caused by the pandemic. The Emir of Rano in Kano and the Emir of Kaura Namoda in Zamfara both died in the last three days. The Emir of Daura, Umar Faruk Umar is close to 90. Giving an update on the COVID-19 infections in the state, Masari said there was no ulterior motive to the decision to quarantine the palace, which receives daily visitors. He said, “Palace is a place where people visit all the time, we take this decision to contain spread of coronavirus. “Reports reaching me reveal that people in rural areas don’t obey the order, people gather during marriages, naming ceremonies, burials and other social gatherings. I have directed the Emirs of Katsina and Daura to deal decisively with anyone violating the order. We directed security agencies to ensure strict compliance on the restriction of movements, the tribunals will continue to prosecute violators.” Katsina, which shares a border of Kano where there has an explosion of covid-19 cases, has itself reported 55 cases over the last one week.
