The Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, has applauded the arrest of Félicien Kabuga, the financier of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda. Kabuga, who was arrested in France on May 16, 2020 after 23 years on the run, was indicted by the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in 1997 on seven counts of genocide, complicity in genocide, direct and public incitement to commit genocide, attempt to commit genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, persecution and extermination, all in relation to crimes committed during the Genocide against the Tutsis. Mahamat, who spoke in a statement on Monday, said Kabuga’s arrest was in line with decision of the AU Peace and Security Council at its 836th meeting held on 3rd April 2019. He called on all AU Member States and Members of the International Community to arrest, prosecute or extradite fugitives accused of genocide “The arrest is in line with decision of the AU Peace and Security Council at its 836th meeting held on 3rd April 2019, calling on all AU Member States and Members of the International Community to arrest, prosecute or extradite fugitives accused of genocide. “This clarion call was reaffirmed by the Resolution 74/273 of the United Nations General Assembly during its 74th Session on 20 April 2020 in which UN Member States are urged to investigate, arrest, prosecute or extradite all remaining genocide fugitives.” Mahamat further charged international community to increase efforts to fight the ideology of genocide, denialism and impunity. “This is an opportunity to encourage the continuation of collective efforts and cooperation of all AU Member States and the International Community for the arrest of the remaining fugitives that are still at large. Let us ensure justice is served for the victims and survivors of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda,” he said.
