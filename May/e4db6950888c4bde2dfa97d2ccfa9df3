The Adamawa State Government says it has discharged eight more COVID-19 patients from isolation centre in Yola. The State Commissioner for Health, Professor Abdullahi Isa, who announced this on Friday, said that the eight were discharged eight after they all tested negative twice for Coronavirus. “This is in line with the protocol of the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). We had earlier discharged 5 on Monday and eight today,” he said. He said Adamawa State had 181 suspected cases in all while 21 have diagnosed positive. Professor Isa noted that as at the time of the briefing there were only eight patients at the isolation centre and expressed the hope that they would also test negative in subsequent tests. He stressed that it had gone a long way to prove to those skeptical about the disease, that the disease was real and people could come out fully treated. The commissioner conveyed Governor Fintiri’s appreciation to people of the state for their understanding and support during the period of containment of COVID-19. Adamawa State now has only eight patients left at its isolation centre.
