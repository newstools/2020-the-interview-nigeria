Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, has revealed how the person who leaked draft of president Muhammadu Buhari’s Monday speech was apprehended. Mr. Adesina, who described the person as an enemy of the state in an article he published on his Facebook page on Friday, said the person was fished out through “computer evidences “. Adesina said President Muhammadu Buhari’s speech was leaked to embarrass the government before Nigerians. “However,  the person behind the leak is now “answering for his evil act”. “But he forgot that in these days of technology, almost everything leaves a trail. Before the end of that evening, computer evidences had narrowed down the suspect, and he was already answering for his evil action”, Mr. Adesina said. He said though the original copy of president Buhari’s speech was released by 8.06pm, some media houses went on to publish the leaked copy which misled the public. Mr. Adesina said, “Those who began to share an obvious leak, rebroadcasting it, are also not guiltless.”
