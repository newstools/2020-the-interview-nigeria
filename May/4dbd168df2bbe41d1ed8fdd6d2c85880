Founder of Daar Communications Plc, Dr. Raymond Aleogho Dokpesi has praised the team of medical personnel who attended to him at the Gwagwalada isolation Centre for COVID-19 positive patients, describing them as eminent Nigerians who put their lives on line for the wellbeing of others. Dokpesi who was speaking on Thursday shortly after he was discharged said he went into the isolation centre at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital as an ordinary citizen and complied to see what the ordinary man goes through. He said, “I did not go into Gwagwalada as High Chief Raymond Dokpesi. I went there as an ordinary citizen.” Speaking of the medical personnel in the country, he said though they were few, they were very professional and could be compared to anyone in any part of the world. Dokpesi said, “By the special grace of God, I went there with nine; we were nine that went, including myself. Yesterday, three of us were discharged.  By the special grace of God, I bet that all the others will join later this evening. “I am very confident that the results have been coming out in batches. At least for the last seven days, I am aware that everybody was feeling strong, hale and hearty.” He said, “The delay is not just shortage of test kits and the intervals between the release of the results, which is extended and there is break down of equipment in laboratories. The fatigue and overwork by members of the medical team who have had to handle, not only ourselves at the isolation centre but indeed, five of the six neighbouring states.”
