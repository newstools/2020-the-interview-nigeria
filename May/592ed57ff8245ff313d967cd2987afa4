The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has said that inter-state movement, mass social and religious gatherings are still prohibited as Muslims get set for Eid-al-Fitr celebrations. In a statement shared on the Nigerian Police Force twitter page on Friday, Mr. Adamu, congratulated all Muslims in the country as they celebrate this year’s Eid al-Fitr and urged them to voluntarily comply with the prevention regulations to overcome COVID-19. Adamu advised them to adhere all the established guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19, like inter-state movement restriction, national curfew and the prohibition of mass socio-religious gatherings. He said, “The Force however reminds the citizens that the COVID-19 prevention regulation orders including the inter-state movement restriction orders, national curfew and the prohibition of mass socio-religious gatherings by the Federal Government in Lagos, Ogun, Kano States and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), and restriction orders by Governments in some States of the Federation, are still in force. “It therefore enjoins the citizens to observe the Eid celebrations bearing in mind the unusual times occasioned by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic as the Force will leave no stone unturned towards the due enforcement.” The IGP also assured the nation of adequate security during and after the Eid al-Fitr celebrations, noting that proactive and robust anti-crime measures, including the deployments of tactical and intelligence assets of the Force, were already in place to prevent any untoward incidents in the country.
