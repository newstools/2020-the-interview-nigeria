The Nigerian Medical Association has advised all its members in Lagos to stay at home in protest of the continued intimidation and harassment by security operatives. According to the doctors, what they experience on the roads is contrary to the directive of the president exempting essential workers from the curfew and restriction on movement to curb the spread of COVID-19. The NMA said on Wednesday that the level of harassment was so bad that ambulances with emergency patients were also impounded by the police. In a statement jointly signed by the chairman,  Dr. Daliu Oseni and secretary, Dr. Moronkola Ramon both of the Lagos branch of the association, all members were advised to indefinitely sit at home in protest, effective Wednesday 6PM May 20, 2020. The statement said, “As a direct result of the conflicting directives of the government and the Lagos State command of the Police, the Lagos State branch of the Nigerian Medical Association was inundated yesterday (Tuesday May 19, 2020) evening with several cases of harassment and intimidation of doctors and other healthcare workers by Officers and Men of the Lagos Stae Police command on the directive of the Commissioner of Police to the extent that even ambulances carrying patients with emergency cases were impounded. This has became a recurring issue. “The Lagos State branch of the NMA has resolved that it is presently unsafe for members to continue to provide healthcare services under the present confused arrangement.”
