The Catholic Bishop Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) has donated all its health facilities across the country as isolation centres for COVID-19. The Secretary to the government of the federation, Boss Mustapha, disclosed this at the Presidential Task Force On COVID-19 briefing on Monday. Mustapha said, “As part of efforts to support the states in the establishment of the isolation and treatment centres, I wish to remind our governors that the Catholic Bishops Conference has volunteered all the 425 hospitals and clinics nationwide for adaptation and use as isolation centres”. He also urged governors to contact the Catholic Bishops in their states to access the donated centres. “Governors are encouraged to please approach Catholic Bishops in their states to access these facilities,” Mustapha said.
