The Nigerian government has impounded an aircraft belonging to a British company for operating commercial flights into Nigeria. The Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, who made this known on Sunday via his Twitter handle, said Flair Aviation, a UK company, was authorised to conduct humanitarian flights but was caught operating commercial flights. He said, “COVID-19. Flair Aviation, a UK company, was given approval for humanitarian operations but regrettably we caught them conducting commercial flights.” Sirika said the crew members of the impounded aircraft are under interrogation and they will face maximum penalty. “This is callous! The craft is impounded, crew being interrogated. There shall be maximum penalty. Wrong time to try our resolve!, he said. The secretary to the government of the federation, Boss Mustapha, at the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 daily briefing on May 6, had announced that the Federal Government had extended the ban on local and international flights for additional four weeks.
