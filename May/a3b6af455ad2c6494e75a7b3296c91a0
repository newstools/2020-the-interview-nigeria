The governor of Niger State, Abubakar Sani Bello, has said that effort of security agencies to rid Niger State of banditry is being sabotaged by some highly-placed members of the affected communities who act as informants for the bandits. Bello, who urged citizens to report persons suspected to be aiding and abetting banditry in the state, said this in a statement he shared on twitter on Thursday. The governor applauded security agencies for their efforts, blaming saboteurs within the communities for divulging security strategies to bandits and helping them evade security agencies and vigilantes. Bello said “In our renewed fight against banditry, we wish to applaud security agencies and vigilantes. “We regret that their effort is being sabotaged by informants who divulge strategies of the security operatives and their movement. “This is a very serious challenge for us because the bandits are working with some highly-placed members of the affected communities by giving out vital information thereby aiding bandits from being tactically isolated and overrun. Bello urged the citizens to corporate with security agencies by sharing information that could help rid Niger State of those behind banditry. He said, “We will not be deterred by the unpatriotic activities of such saboteurs. We will continue to do everything possible to bring an end to crime and criminality in our dear state. “I assure you that all hands are on deck to ensure that we provide safe and secure environment for our people. Our success against these miscreants can only be accelerated with provision of proper knowledge and intelligence about them, hence the need for the support of all.”
