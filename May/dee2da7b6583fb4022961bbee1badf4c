The Rivers State Government has accused some unnamed politicians of plotting to use the COVID-19 pandemic to declare a state of emergency in the state. Governor Nyesom Wike’s commissioner of information,  Paulinus Nsirim, made the allegation in a statement on Wednesday. He described the present plot as a repeat of a failed attempt to impose emergency rule in the state during the 2019 governorship election. He said, “They did everything within their powers to ensure that the 2019 Governorship Election results were not announced but also failed. “As the build up for the 2023 elections and jostle for Presidential and Vice-Presidential tickets is gathering momentum, they want to use COVID-19 to create a crisis as if the State is at war with the Federal Government. “They have decided to create unnecessary tension as if indigenes of Ahoada, Eleme and Port Harcourt are fighting with Northerners not to carry out their legitimate businesses.” According to the statement, other states like Enugu, Lagos, Cross River, Akwa Ibom, Edo and Kaduna States have been intercepting lorries carrying human beings instead of foodstuffs. “This is the same thing that the Rivers State Government is doing to protect the State from COVID-19. “Bandits have been killing innocent people in Sokoto, Katsina, Zamfara and Kaduna States and indigenes of these States, no matter their political differences, are working together to protect their States.” “But here in Rivers State, instead of supporting our efforts, these Abuja politicians are busy looking for a State of Emergency because they want to acquire power,” he said. The commissioner added that they were alarmed at the  plots against the state  and that “Rivers State has never fought a war with strangers or neighbours”. He further said the state’s fight against COVID-19 was to protect the lives of everyone living and doing business in the state and that they were aware that some shameless politicians were playing politics with COVID-19.
