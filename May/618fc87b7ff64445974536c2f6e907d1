The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has said that the Supreme Court judgement that annulled former governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu’s conviction, is “unfortunate” and “a technical ambush against the trial of the former governor”. The Supreme Court had on Friday morning quashed the conviction of former governor of Abia State, Orji Kalu, his firm, Slok Nigeria Limited and Jones Udeogu, a former Director of Finance and Account of Abia State Government, ordering their fresh trial at the lower court. However, in statement on Friday afternoon signed by Dele Oyewale, its Head of media and publicity, the anti-graft agency described the Supreme judgement as ‘unfortunate’. “The attention of the Economic And Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has been drawn to the judgment of the Supreme Court nullifying the trial of a former governor of Abia State, Orji Kalu, his firm, Slok Nigeria Limited and Jones Udeogu, a former Director of Finance and Account of Abia State Government and ordering their fresh trial at the lower court. “The EFCC considers the judgment of the apex court as quite unfortunate. It is an ambush against the trial of the former governor,” the statement said. The EFCC also indicated its preparedness to prosecute Uzor Kalu over again. It said, “The Commission is prepared for a fresh and immediate trial of the case because its evidences against Kalu and others are overwhelming. “The corruption charges against Kalu still subsist because the Supreme Court did not acquit him of them. The entire prosecutorial machinery of the EFCC would be launched in a fresh trial where justice is bound to be served in due course.”
