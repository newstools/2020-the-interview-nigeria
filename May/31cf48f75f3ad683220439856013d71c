He said the guidelines for private laboratories to join in running COVID-19 test would be published on NCDC Website on Monday night and that those that want to participate would know what to do. “So we have come up with a guideline. Any private sector lab that wants to join in COVID-19 testing can go pick up this guideline that we are going to publish on our website tonight, look through it, define what they need to do to join the network and we will support them”, Ihekweazu said.
