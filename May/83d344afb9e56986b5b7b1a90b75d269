The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control on Tuesday reported 148 new COVID-19 cases in the country putting the official death toll from the pandemic at 98. Even though the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 has yet to conclude investigations into the more than 650 unexplained deaths in Kano, the NCDC is yet to say whether it plans to revise its figures on the number of recorded deaths in the country. Dr. Sani Gwarzo from the presidential Task force team had on Sunday linked most of the deaths in the state to COVID-19 only to recant a day later so as not to preempt results of ongoing investigation. Added to the deaths in Kano, more than 100 deaths have now been recorded in parts of neighbouring Jigawa. Scores of individuals, including prominent personalities and traditional rulers have also died in hospitals while waiting to either be tested for COVID-19 or the test results. It is not clear if deaths in such circumstances are accounted for in NCDC tally. However, there are now 2,950 confirmed cases of the coronavirus with 481 patients recovered and discharged from treatment and isolation centres according to NCDC official count. 43 new cases were reported in Lagos, 32 in Kano, 14 in Zamfara and 10 in the FCT. Nine new cases were reported in Katsina, seven in Taraba, six each in Borno and Ogun, and five in Oyo. In Edo, Kaduna and Bauchi, there were three reported cases in each state and two cases each reported in Adamawa and Gombe. Plateau, Sokoto and Kebbi had one case each.
