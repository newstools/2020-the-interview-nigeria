The Nigerian Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, has said that he joined politics out of unemployment and not because he wanted to solve Nigeria’s problems as a leader. Amaechi, who was a two-term governor of Rivers State, made this statement in an interview with The Punch published on Sunday. When asked at what point he developed interest in politics, Amaechi replied that he joined politics due to unemployment. “My father was a politician. He ran for councillorship during his time. However, I didn’t join politics because I wanted to be a leader or because I wanted to solve Nigeria’s problems. I joined because of unemployment. I also believe there is a part that grace played in it”, Amaechi said. Amaechi added that he would have been a broadcaster with the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) but he joined politics before his employment letter came. He said, “I actually got auditioned at the Nigeria Television Authority to be a broadcaster. I recall that I walked into their office then and said I wanted to see a certain person. But the person I met asked me if I had been auditioned because I had a wonderful voice. “I told him I hadn’t and he asked for me to be auditioned. However, before the employment letter came, I was already into politics. That saved me. I would have been a broadcaster by now.”
