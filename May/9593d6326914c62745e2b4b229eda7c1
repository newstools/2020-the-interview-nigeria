The Presidential Task Force sent to Kano to investigate the more than 600 unexplained deaths in the state has concluded that some of the deaths were caused by COVID-19. Dr. Nasiru Gwarzo who led the team confirmed this to journalists during the handover ceremony of a mobile testing laboratory donated by the Aliko Dangote Foundation in Kano on Sunday. Gwarzo said, “Let me inform us that most of the deaths recorded of recent and test carried out showed that Coronavirus was the cause. “So, before the final report which would be ready in the next one week or few days, it is necessary for people of Kano to wake up from their slumber that this is a serious issue. He noted that the team was successful in identifying what the problems were and was also happy with the level of  cooperation they received from the private sector and other stake holders. “Many people have come out to support the state. We cannot expand our investigation until we are certain. We have five cogent reasons to say that the mass death recorded in Kano is associated with Coronavirus,” Gwarzo added.
