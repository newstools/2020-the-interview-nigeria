One of the five first class emirs in Kano State, the Emir of Rano, Dr Tafida Abubakar Ila II, is dead. The deceased was taken to the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital for an undisclosed illness after which he was transferred Nasarawa Specialist Hospital, where he died at about 4:45pm on Saturday. He was 74 years old. Tafida Ila was only recently appointed Emir after Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano created four new Emirates with Rano being one of them. A former speaker of the Kano State House of Assembly, Kabiru Rurum, who confirmed his death also said that his remains would soon be buried according to Islamic rites. Kano has in the last one week reported a number of unexplained deaths mostly of elderly citizens that have included top academics and retired public officers.
