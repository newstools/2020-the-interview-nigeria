Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has said that he will win re-election regardless of indirect or direct primaries and no man can stop his reelection. Obaseki, who attributed his first electoral victory to God, said this in an interview on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily on Wednesday. “I am not a violent person. But I am confident that the way I got into power is the same way I will return. “God gave me power. If he wants me to return I will continue. No man can stop me. Power comes from God,” he said, adding that “It does not matter whether it is direct or indirect (primaries), I will win”. While speaking on election violence, Obaseki reiterated that though he believed election should not lead to bloodshed, he would not be cowed by those who think they can manipulate the system. He said, “We have always canvassed for peace. What are the issues in Edo and what are the issues that cannot be resolved in a democracy. Our concern is to use the resources of the people to develop the state. “This shouldn’t lead to bloodshed. We will not accept to be cowed and intimidated because some people think that they can manipulate rules and cut corners.” Edo governorship election is scheduled to hold on September 19 2020, according to the Independent Electoral Commission(INEC).
