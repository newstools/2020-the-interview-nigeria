US President, Donald Trump’s tweet in which he threatened to mobilise the army to shoot protesters on Friday, has been flagged by Twitter for violating the platform’s rules. Trump had, in a tweet on Friday, labelled those protesting the killing of George Floyd, thugs, threatening to mobilise the military to suppress them. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts”, Trump said. Appending a tag to the Trump’s tweet, Twitter said it glorifies violence which is against its rules. “This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible,” Twitter said.
