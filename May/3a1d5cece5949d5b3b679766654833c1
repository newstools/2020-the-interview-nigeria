The Federal Government says the pilots of the British aircraft that violated Nigeria’s flight ban will be quarantined for 14 days. The Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, said this at the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 daily briefing on Monday. The Interview had reported how Flair Aviation, a UK company, given approval for humanitarian operations was caught conducting commercial flight into the country on Sunday. Speaking during the briefing, Sirika said, “We believe that the whole essence of lockdown is to ensure there is no movement of persons freely. This COVID-19 happened because someone travelled and brought it in. If you want to catch fish, empty the water. So, this shouldn’t happen”. Sirika added that the issue was still under investigation, and that the culprit would be duly sanctioned. He said, “We are investigating the matter right now. It will finish very soon. The pilots will be subjected to 14-day quarantine while investigation goes on. “The aircraft is impounded in Lagos. And the crew are British nationals. Whatever is there in our laws will be applied to the fullest.”
