The former Nigerian minister of youth and sports, Solomon Dalung, has said that President Muhammadu Buhari’s government failed the test of transparency in its handling of palliatives for the poor. Dalung, who served as a minister between 2015 and 2019, made this known in a tweet on Wednesday. He said the distribution of palliatives by the Federal Government had failed every known human test of transparency. “The distribution of FG palliatives has failed all known human test for transparency,” Dalung said.  He also added that the President’s effort to tackle hunger had been compromised and hunger was now an epidemic in the country. Dalung said, “This has compromised efforts of Mr. President to attack hunger now an epidemic. While suffering persists, those responsible @MBuhari, have looked the other. This is unhealthy to Covid-19 war.” He charged President Buhari to lead by example, adding that the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 should give transparent account of all donations received. “Instead of telling us daily figures of covid-19 which is scary, PTF should give transparent account of all donations & equipments received, palliatives administration…They should lead by example which is key to winning the war against pandemic”, he said. Instead of telling us daily figures of covid-19 which is scary, PTF should give transparent account of all donations & equipments received, palliatives administration. @MBuhari, @NCDCgov. They should lead by example which is key to winning the war against pandemic. — Solomon Dalung (@SolomonDalung) May 13, 2020  It would be recalled that while he was minister, Dalung sat on $130,000 erroneously transferred by the World Athletics, formerly known as the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), for two years. He attacked those insisting he should make the refund, calling them “enemies of the country.” He later authorised the refund under relentless pressure.
