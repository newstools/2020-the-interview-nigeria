National Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has hailed the appointment of Professor Ibrahim Agboola Gambari as the new Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari as “most sagacious”. Reacting to the development on Wednesday in Abuja, Comrade Oshiomhole said the world-renowned diplomat and celebrated scholar would bring a lot of value to the Buhari administration in terms of new ideas, leveraging his clout as a global player. The APC National Chairman said, “For us in APC, we see the appointment of Professor Gambari as not only well-deserved but also reflective of the uncommon wisdom of President Buhari as the father of the nation. From his resume alone, you will see that the new Chief of Staff is eminently qualified and very experienced in public service. “With this appointment, President Buhari has again demonstrated his knack for putting round peg in round hole. “In APC, we see Professor Gambari as someone who has always espoused the values we hold dear – the values of democracy, patriotism, accountability and social justice. His commitment to the growth and development of the nation over the last four decades is certainly not in doubt. “Nothing perhaps demonstrates this better than the fact that, after his last public outing, Professor Gambari chose to set up a non-governmental organisation devoted entirely to the stimulation of fresh ideas to enrich good governance and promote democracy. “On behalf of the the National Working Committee and teeming members of All Progressives Congress at home and in Diaspora, I congratulate him and wish him a successful tenure.”
