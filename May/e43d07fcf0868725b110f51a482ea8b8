A former Kano State Commissioner for Works, Engr. Muazu Magaji, who celebrated the death of Abba Kyari, the late Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari has tested positive of COVID-19. Magaji was later sacked by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje for comments he made on social media after the passing away of the chief of staff. Magaji has reportedly been moved to an isolation centre. The state government said Magaji was sacked for sacked for his unguarded utterances against the person of the late Chief of Staff to the President, Malam Abba Kyari. According to the government the commissioner, being a public servant, ought to have respected the office by refraining from any act capable of exposing the office to disrepute.
