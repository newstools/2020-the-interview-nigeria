Professor Ibrahim Gambari, President Muhammadu Buhari’s new Chief of Staff (CoS) has said that what the president needs most at this time is loyalty and that he was ready to serve him to the best of his ability. Gambari, who spoke while answering questions from State House correspondents shortly after assuming his duties as the President’s new Chief of Staff on Wednesday, also thanked the president for appointing him. “I want to thank the President of the Federal Republic for giving me this opportunity to serve him and of the country,” he said. The Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha, had announced Gambari as the new CoS to the President shortly before the start of the virtual meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. When he was asked what Nigerians should expect from him, the new chief of staff said, “I have not started. So, I will find out and maybe… I don’t report directly to the nation. I report directly to the president.” But he readily answered when he was asked what President Buhari should expect from him. “I think he needs my loyalty, competence and support,” he said.
