The Kano State branch of the Nigeria Council of Ulamas has come strongly against the decision of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje to lift the ban on congregational prayers in the state without considering the spread of COVID-19. The governor, the council said is putting people’s lives at risk. The Ulemas also disputed the governor’s claim that he had consulted leading clerics in the state before lifting the ban on congregational prayers saying the Kano State Ulamas were not consulted. Chairman of the council in Kano, Sheik Ibrahim Khaleel spoke with BBC Hausa Service on Wednesday where he expressed dismay at the decision of the governor. Khaleel said the state government had not made public health its top priority in coming to the decision. He however said it was now left to individuals to decide for themselves whether to risk their lives and go out to pray in congregation since the government has already decided to allow for the prayers.
