The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says that delay in the receipt of collated results of the governorship election from local government areas in Edo has delayed the collation at the state level. INEC National Commissioner May Agbamuche-Mbu announced this on Sunday in Benin. Agbamuche-Mbu, INEC commissioner incharge of Edo, Bayelsa and Rivers, is the commissioner overseeing the Edo election. Addressing journalists and party agents at the state collation centre, INEC headquarters, Benin, she said that results were still being expected from the 18 local government areas of the state. She said, “This is to inform you all that we are still waiting for results from the local government areas. “I am sorry we have to wait before we start collation. Only one local government has arrived in the centre. “We are going to wait until at least, when results from seven local government areas arrive in the centre before we start. “We do not want anybody to cast aspersions on us. So we are going to wait,”. (NAN) Governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Goveror Godwin Obaseki of Edo State has won in the polling unit of former National chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun. The APC candidate Osagie Ize-Iyamu is Obaseki’s main challenger in the Saturday election. Obaseki polled 109 votes, while Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the APC got 40 votes. Oyegun has been at loggerheads with Adams Oshiomhole, also a former APC chairman and the main backer of Ize-Iyamu. Obaseki won his own polling unit in Oredo Ward 4, Unit 19. He polled 184 votes to Ize-Iyamu’s 62 votes. The deputy governor, Philip Shaibu, won his polling unit with 401 votes to APC’s 148 votes. Results trickling in a handle of polling units show the PDP winning many of them. However, a clearer picture will emerge when results are collated at the local government level.
