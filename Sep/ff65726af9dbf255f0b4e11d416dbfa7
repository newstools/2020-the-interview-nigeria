These include Nyanya, Bwari and Kwali General Hospitals and the Primary Healthcare centers at Kwali, Gbadalape and Kogo. He added that the implementation of the MPDSR project in these areas had reduced the maternal mortality ratio in the FCT to below the national average. “In Bwari Area Council, the maternal mortality ratio was reduced from 504/100,000 in 2014 to 468/100,000 in 2019. “While maternal mortality was reduced from 317/100,000 in 2014 to 221/100,000 in 2019 in Nyanya, while the figures dropped in Kwali Area Council from 329/100,000 in 2014 to 268/100,000 in 2019,” he said. He revealed that the national average in 2008, 2013 and 2018 were 545/100,000, 576/100,000 and 512/100,000 respectively. Akinola also commended the FCTA for the establishment of a budget line for the MPDSR programmes in the FCT, adding that the FCT was the first state in the country to do so. He said that the MPDSR project in the FCT had increased consciousness and accountability of health workers as they have become more conscious on issues relating to maternal and perinatal deaths. (NAN)
