The  Nigerian government has said it considers it disrespectful to the Sovereignty of the country for any outside country to apply punitive measures such as visas restriction on its citizens. It made this known in a statement issued by Mr. Ferdinand Nwonye, Spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday in Abuja. This comes as a response to the recent announcement of the U.S. and the United Kingdom to impose visa restrictions on those who undermine electoral processes. The Nigerian Government said it was committed to providing all necessary logistics, financial and security support to the electoral process. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs wishes to state that the Nigerian government has taken note of the concerns of some of our partners, especially the U.S. and UK governments regarding the elections in Edo and Ondo States. “They have also expressed their intentions to take punitive measures against those who decide to, in what they termed as, undermine democracy. “It is important to highlight that the responsibility for the conduct of elections in Nigeria solely resides with the Independent National Electoral Commission and State Independent Electoral Commissions.

The government called on the partners to support security agencies by providing them whatever concrete evidence of observed misconduct to allow our laws and regulations to take their course. The Nigerian government also expressed solidarity with the government and people of the US as regards their forthcoming election, which it hoped would be free from interference and violence. (NAN)
