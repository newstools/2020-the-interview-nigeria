In July, we had 13 states that actually collected over 1,000 samples. “For August, no state met that target. That means we had zero states collecting over 1,000 samples. For the local government areas, in July we had 515 that collected samples and it decreased to 478 in August. We can appreciate the decrease in August.” READ ALSO: Nigeria Becomes Fourth In Africa To Report 1000 COVID-19 Deaths He said, “In August, states with the biggest increase are Abia 682, Sokoto 331, Bayelsa 314, Zamfara 55 and Yobe 12, but the numbers are not significant at all.
