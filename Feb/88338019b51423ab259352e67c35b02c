The Ogun state government has shut down Lafarge cement factory in the Ewekoro area of the state and placed at least 28 persons who came in contact with Nigeria’s first coronavirus patient under quarantine. Dapo Abiodun, the governor, disclosed this while giving an update on measures taken to check the spread of the disease. The index case of coronavirus in Nigeria arrived at Murtala Muhammed International Airport via a Turkish Airline flight on Monday. The Italian, who is a consultant of Lafarge, reportedly spent the night at an undisclosed hotel near the airport and moved down to the company’s premises in Ewekoro on Tuesday morning. He was said to have carried out his business within the confines of the company on Tuesday and in the early part of Wednesday. The Italian, who was said to have spent the night within Lafarge premises, started to develop symptoms of high fever and body pains in the afternoon of Wednesday and was then taken to the company’s medical facility where the investigation began. The patient is currently being isolated at the state’s bio-security facility in the Yaba area of Lagos. Earlier, Lafarge announced that it had identified all the people who had direct contact with the patient. Credit: The Cable
