A federal high court in the Federal Capital Territory has ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to refrain from deregistering 31 political parties. Justice Anwuli Chikere who gave the order on Monday acted on a suit initiated by some of the political parties saying the parties had legal rights which must be protected. Justice Chikere said the commission failed to file a counter application to the motion filed on October 30, 2019 by the Advanced Congress of Democracy and two others against the Attorney General of the Federation and another. On February 6, 2020, INEC announced the reregistration of 74 political parties after a review of their performances in the 2019 general elections but said it left out the parties who filed the October 30 interlocutory motion.
