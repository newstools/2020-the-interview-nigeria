The Federal High Court in Lagos State on Thursday fixed April 2, for the arraignment of Ifeanyi Ubah and his company, Capital Oil and Gas Industries Limited, over an indebtedness of N135bn to the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON). According to a statement by Jude Nwuzor, AMCON’s head of corporate communication, the senator’s planned arraignment before Justice Nicholas Oweibo could not hold on Thursday as Ubah did not show up in court. Nwuzor stated that Mr. Kunle Adegoke, the Counsel for the Federal Government, Kunle Adegoke, had told the judge that the prosecution was having difficulty serving the charge sheet on Ubah, alleging that the businessman was evading service. Adegoke, therefore, applied for a court order to serve the charge sheet on Ubah, through his lawyer, Dr. Olisa Agbakoba, SAN. He said, “In an affidavit sworn to by para-legal staff of Kunle Adegoke law firm, Haleemah Adegoke, declared that the bailiff of the court told her that, he took steps to effect service of the charge dated October 30, 2019 on Ubah personally in December, 2019 at the registered office of Capital Oil and Gas Industries Limited., but he was unable to serve him personally. Since then he has been evading service of same.” Justice Oweibo granted the prayer and adjourned till April 2 for Ubah’s arraignment. This is as the counsel representing Capital Oil and Gas Limited, Mr. Ajibola Oluyede, told the court that there was an ongoing process for amicable settlement of the matter.
