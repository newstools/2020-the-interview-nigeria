The Presidency on Tuesday said it would not sack service chiefs’ based on public call for such, saying “this is not the right time to sack head of security agencies”. Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, made this known at a book launch in Abuja while responding to questions from journalists. Mustapha said there were processes to be followed before service chiefs are sacked and such would be compromised because there are calls to sack present service chiefs. “You don’t sack people like that. There are processes and I believe that, at the opportune time, those processes will be followed. You don’t just wake up and say sack people, it doesn’t happen like that,” he said.
