The presidency has debunked the rumour that President Muhammadu Buhari is set to embark on a 20-day trip to the United Kingdom. Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, in a statement on Monday said the rumour targeted at the president is being promoted by enemies of national Cohesion. Mr. Adesina urged the general public to disregard such information and be mindful of what they take as news from the social media, noting that purveyors of fake and concocted information are currently on overdrive. He stated, “An unfounded information has been making the rounds that President Muhammadu Buhari is billed to travel to the United Kingdom for 20 days, and from there proceed to Saudi Arabia, and then Austria. It is nothing but falsehood from mischievous minds. “Members of the First Family, Ministers, top government officials, the military, and other key institutions, are equally objects of this orchestrated falsehood, coming from enemies of national cohesion. “We urge Nigerians to be discriminatory about what they accept as credible information, and restrain themselves from sharing what they have not authenticated as genuine.”
