A federal high court in Cross River has granted a N10m  bail to journalist, Agba Jalingo, who has been detained since August 2019. The journalist had been charged with treason and conspiracy to remove the elected governor of Cross River a state, Ben Ayade. He was arrested by the police on August 22, 2019, after a July 2019 article alleging diversion of N500m meant for Cross River State Microfinance Bank by the Cross River government. Jalingoâ€™s case was initially heard by Justice Simon Amobeda of the federal high court in Calabar who twice denied the publisher of Cross River Watch bail and later recused himself over accusations of bias. After the two previously failed attempts to secure bail, Jalingo was granted bail on Thursday by Justice Sule Shuaibu and was asked to deposit N700, 000 with the court registry. This followed an application by his lawyer, Attahiru Ochinke.
