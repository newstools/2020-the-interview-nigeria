The Supreme Court has adjourned until March 2, 2020; the case between Emeka Ihedioha of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), who had his election as governor of Imo State annulled by the apex court and Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who was declared the rightful winner by the court. Ihedioha and the PDP are asking the court to review its January 14, 2020 judgement that cancelled their March 9, 2019 governorship election victory in Imo. After a request for a seven-day adjournment by Kanu Agabi, the lawyer to Ihedioha, the seven man panel hearing the case chose March 2 to continue the case. Agabi told the panel headed by Chief Justice Tanko that the request was to enable him file and receive all processes necessary to prove his case. Ihedioha has asked the court to set aside the January 14 judgement saying the APC misled the court in getting it. The panel heard all the motions filed by the parties before adjourning the case for further hearing. While none of the respondents opposed Agabi’s application, Uzodinma’s legal team said the court could no longer rule the election petition case as the 60-day timeframe stipulated by the constitution has elapsed. Uzodinma said, “Order 8, Rule 16 of the Supreme Court Rules 2014 prohibits the apex court from reviewing its judgement once given and delivered, save to correct clerical mistakes or accidental slip.
