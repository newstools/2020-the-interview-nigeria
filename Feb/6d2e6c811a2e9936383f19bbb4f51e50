Agba Jalingo, a Nigerian journalist on trial for treason was finally released on Monday upon meeting bail conditions. Jalingo, who has spent 179 days in detention, was arrested and charged with treason for publishing a story on how Cross River State Governor, Professor Ben Ayade, allegedly approved and diverted N500m meant for Cross River State Microfinance Bank, on August 22, 2019. A federal high court in Cross River granted Jalingo a N10m bail on Thursday last week.  However, the journalist finally gained freedom on Monday after perfecting bail conditions. Mr. Jalingo was earlier denied bail twice by another judge, Simon Amobeda, who recently recused from the case after a secret recording where he allegedly vowed to give against Mr. Jalingo ‘the Ken Saro Wiwa treatment’ was leaked to the press late last year.
