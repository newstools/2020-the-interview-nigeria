The Independent National Electoral Commission on Friday issued a certificate of return to Douye Diri, the candidate of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party as winner the November 16, 2019 governorship election in Bayelsa State. Diri who collected the certificate of return just after midday at INEC headquarters in Maitama, Abuja was earlier on Friday morning denied entry into the commission because the electoral body was yet to review the Supreme Court judgement that declared him winner of the election. This sets the stage for Diri be sworn in as governor on February 15, 2020 instead of David Lyon of the All Progressive Congress whose election victory was annulled on Thursday by the Supreme Court and his Certificate of Return ordered to be withdrawn by the court. Earlier on Friday, INEC held a closed door meeting to decide what course to take in the wake of the Supreme Court judgement ordering the next candidate with the most votes and required constitutional spread to be issued the certificate of return. INEC chairman, Prof. Mahmud Yakubu, after the meeting addressed the press saying Diri would be issued the certificate of return as ordered by the Supreme Court. The commission, he said came to the decision after discounting the votes of the APC candidate whose victory had been voided by the apex. From the remaining votes cast, the PDP met the spread and majority votes. Yakubu, in the address said the tenure of Governor Seriake Dickson would be coming to an end at midnight Friday, February 14, 2020. National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole in response to the judgement had claimed no candidate other than the disqualified Lyon met the required spread and therefore could be declared winner.
