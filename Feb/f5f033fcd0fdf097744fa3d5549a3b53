A former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, has said that the recent attack of Boko Haram which claimed the lives of about 30 Nigerians in Borno State should prod the country to explore  better options to tackle insurgency in the country. About 30 travellers who were stranded outside the military-controlled entrance gate of Maiduguri were killed by the insurgents on Sunday. Reacting to the incident in a tweet, Atiku, who sympathised with families of the deceased, said Nigerians could not afford to stay divided in the face their common enemy. “We can’t afford to stay divided in the face of this common enemy. I sympathise with the bereaved families, he said. He added that it was time for the country to explore all possible options to put an end to Boko Haram menace. “These incidents, one too many, should make us explore all possible options to put a stop to this scourge”, he said.
