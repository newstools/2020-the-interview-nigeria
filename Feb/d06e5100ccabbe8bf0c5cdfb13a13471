A former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, on Friday said members of the People’s Democratic Party in Bayelsa State must take advantage of Supreme Court decision that returned power to its candidate, Douye Diri, as governor to pursue genuine reconciliation. Saraki, who congratulated Douye Diri and Lawrence Ehrudjakpor over the Supreme Court verdict that sacked David Lyon of the All Progressive Congress as governor-elect on Thursday, said only genuine reconciliation would give the PDP the ground to deliver on its promises to the people of Bayelsa. Saraki who spoke through his twitter page said, “I congratulate Senator Duoye Diri and Senator Lawrence Ehrudjakpor on being declared as the Governor Elect and Deputy Governor Elect of Bayelsa State. I pray Allah will give them the wisdom to deliver on the wishes and aspirations of all Bayelsans. Appealing to PDP members in Bayelsa State, Saraki continued, “I appeal to our party faithful in the State to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by the decision of the Supreme Court to pursue and achieve genuine reconciliation. “Last year I served as Chairman of the Committee set up by @OfficialPDPNig to pursue reconciliation within our ranks in Bayelsa. I make this appeal knowing that only genuine reconciliation will give us the foundation to fully deliver on our campaign promises to the Bayelsa people”.
