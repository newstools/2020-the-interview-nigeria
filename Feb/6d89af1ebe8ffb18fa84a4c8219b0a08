Professor Kingsley Moghalu, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, has charged Nigerian government to deal with Boko Haram insurgents decisively. Moghalu, who was Young Progressive Party presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections, made this statement on twitter on Wednesday. Condemning the release and rehabilitation of repentant Boko Haram, Moghalu said Nigeria should learn from how Chad executed 10 Boko Haram fighters in August 2015. Moghalu said, “Our @NigeriaGov needs to man up to Boko Haram and stop the cuddling. He said the plan to set up an agencies for the welfare of repentant Boko Haram members, while Nigerians are still being killed by terrorists was “state failure.” “Nigerians are being slaughtered by terrorists, while we “integrate”, “rehabilitate” them, and set up government agencies for their welfare. This approach is state failure. Look at Chad. Chad!!, Moghalu said.
