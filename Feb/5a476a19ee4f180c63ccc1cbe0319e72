The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has stressed on its commitment to the promotion of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) usage for efficient services delivery across private and public organisations in Nigeria. Prof. Umar Danbatta, Executive Vice Chairman, NCC, stated this on Wednesday during the presentation of ICT equipment to the Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD), a non-governmental organisation (NGO), in Abuja. Danbatta, who was represented by Abraham Oshadami, Head, Information Technology at NCC, Danbatta underscored the importance of application of ICT tools to daily operations of both private and public institutions in Nigeria and stated that as the national telecom regulator, the Commission is promoting ICT usage in this regard. According to Danbatta, the Commission has the tradition of supporting ICT usage across Nigerian institutions, as this helps to empower the youths and women, in particular, in various public and private institutions. Danbatta stated that this commitment of the NCC had become even more imperative in the light of Federal Government’s digital economy agenda. “Therefore, we want to use this medium to encourage government at all levels and non-governmental organisations to be committed to the use of ICT in their respective statutory obligations to Nigerians. “This is one of the veritable means to deliver good governance and human capacity building to Nigerians. It has been our tradition in NCC to support institutions nationwide with focus on the use of ICT,” Danbatta said.
