Abuja Federal High Court on Wednesday fined the Federal Government the sum of N200, 000 for delaying the trial of Sahara Reporters publisher, Omoyele Sowore, on frivolous grounds. Sowore, who is being tried for treason and insulting president Muhammdu Buhari, was in court on Wednesday to face trial. However, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, who postponed the trial till Thursday, described the prosecution’s request for the adjournment as frivolous and uncalled for. She also expressed her dissatisfaction with the prosecution’s failure to serve all the necessary documents as ordered by the court over seven weeks ago. The judge warned that the proceedings would not continue if the prosecution failed to present evidence of the payment of the N200, 000 to the defence or come to court with the cash on Thursday. The prosecuting counsel, Mr. Kayode Alilu, from the office of the attorney general of the federation, had explained to the court that the amendment of the charges followed the taking over of the case from the Department of State Services in December. He asked for an adjournment to effect the service on the defence. Defence lawyer, Mr. Olayinka Olumide-Fusika (SAN), contended that the prosecution were not prepared for trial and urged the court to strike out the charges, saying the prosecution’s request for an adjournment was frivolous.
