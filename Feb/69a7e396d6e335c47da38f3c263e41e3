Uzodinma Asks Buhari To N32bn Spent By Predecessors Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, has a sought a refund of over N32bn his predecessors spent on federal government’s projects, especially roads in the state. He disclosed that so far, consultants had computed N32bn. The governor visited President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, to seek the refund of the money. Speaking with State House correspondents after the meeting, Uzodinma said he raised the issue with Buhari because Imo was “financially distressed”, adding that he needed the money to pay salaries, pension arrears and other pressing needs. However, he explained that the federal government gave a prior approval of road projects worth N12bn before the state government started the repairs. Uzodinma added that he requested the refund of the N12bn as first tranche during the meeting with Buhari. He stated further, “I have come to request the kind intervention of Mr. President to at least refund some money spent on some of the federal roads in Imo state before my arrival. “We want to address some pressing issues like pension arrears, salary arrears, so that we can get back the people first before we begin to talk of infrastructure. “The consultants are still working but so far we have computed the money in the neighbourhood of N32bn. In my first application to Mr. President, I articulated those ones that we had prior approval before construction and a total sum of N12bn has been recorded. “I have submitted the request and in his magnanimity, he has assured me that he will look into it very considerably.” Uzodinma who revealed that he also briefed Buhari on the situation of things he met on the ground in Imo, said the President was receptive.
