Protests over the recent ban of motorcycle and tricycle riders in Lagos have led to clashes with the police in some parts of the state, early on Monday morning. The state government announced plans to enforce the ban on January 26, 2020. Some of the riders have been protesting in different parts of the state. They blocked the road in Ijora when the police tried to stop them from embarking on the protest leading to the clash. Many commuters have been left stranded with some walking long distances after the ban on motorcycles and tricycles from operating in 15 local governments and certain bridges by the Lagos State Government took effect on February 1, 2020. On Monday, the first workday since the ban took effect, the full impact of the policy was witnessed on the streets of Lagos. The state government had, however, announced that an additional fleet of 65 buses would be deployed on major routes to ease the difficulties being experienced by commuters. The spokesman for the Lagos Bus Services Limited, Afolabi Olawale, said arrangements had been perfected for the smooth operations of these buses in seven new routes.
