The Supreme Court on Wednesday fined two Senior Advocates of Nigeria, Afe Babalola and Wole Olanipekun N60m for misleading their clients, the All Progressives Congress and David Lyon and filing an application asking the court to review its own February 13, 2020 ruling on the Bayelsa governorship tussle. The Supreme Court said, “the decision of this court in appeal No: SC/1/2020 is final for all ages; it is final in the real sense of the word final and no force on earth can make this court shift from its decision delivered in the appeal.” The lead judgement read by Justice Amina Augie said, “to do otherwise is to open a floodgate of litigations on appeals already settled by this court.” The court dismissed the APC application for lacking merit and ordered the Babalola and Olanipekun to each pay the individual defendants; the People’s Democratic Party, Governor Duoye of Bayelsa State and his deputy, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo N10m each. The seven-man panel who delivered the ruling was led by Justice Sylvester Ngwuta and cited Order 8 Rule 16 of the Supreme Court Rules in concluding that the APC application lacked merit and constituted an abuse of court process. The application seeking to reverse the judgement disqualifying Lyon as a candidate and winner of the governorship election, the court said, was not filed to correct a clerical error, accidental slips or to vary a part as contained in the rules.
