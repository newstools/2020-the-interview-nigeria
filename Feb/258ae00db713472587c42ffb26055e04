The management Lafarge Africa Plc says it has identified those who had direct contact with the Italian, who has been confirmed Nigeria’s first case of Coronavirus, at its Ewekoro Plant, Ogun State. According to a statement by Folashade Ambrose-Medebem, Lafarge’s director of communications, public affairs and sustainable Development, the organisation has also initiated isolation, quarantine and disinfection protocol. Recall that Mr. Obafemi Hamzat, the deputy of Lagos State, had told journalists that the unnamed Italian who tested positive to the widely spreading Coronavirus was reported to have visited a manufacturing company in Ewekoro, Ogun State, shortly arriving Nigeria. The manufacturing company has now been identified as Lafarge Cement, Ewekoro. Ambrose-Medebem explained that the Italian worked for a vendor that provides services to Lafarge Africa Plc. While thanking the federal ministry of health, Ogun and Lagos states’ governments for swiftly providing response and testing facilities, she assured the public that they were working in full co-operation with all local authorities. She added, “Lafarge Africa is also working in close partnership with International SOS, our medical service provider, a leading global health company. “Health and Safety remains a core value at Lafarge Africa and we intend to leverage this strength at this critical time.
