President Muhammad Buhari on Wednesday accused Borno leaders of being complicit in the insurgent attacks ravaging the state. The president who spoke to the leaders during his sympathy visit to Borno State, following the killing of about 30 travellers by the insurgents on Sunday, told them that, “Boko Haram cannot come up to Maiduguri or environs without the local leadership knowing.” According to a statement by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, President Buhari, who assured the people that proactive and decisive measures would be taken to put an end to the Boko Haram menace in the country, also charged local community leaders to cooperate with security agencies. “I assure you that improvement in security will be pursued vigorously. The military will work harder and strategise with tactics to deal with the insurgents. This is however not possible without good intelligence and cooperation with local community leaders. “Boko Haram cannot come up to Maiduguri or environs without the local leadership knowing because traditionally, the local leadership is in charge of security in their own respective areas. “I want to call on the leadership at various levels to cooperate with law enforcement agencies and let us deny Boko Haram access to our loyal citizens,” the President said.
