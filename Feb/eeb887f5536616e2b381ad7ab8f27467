The Governors of the six South-West States will meet with the Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Mohammed Adamu, on Thursday (tomorrow) to fine-tune discussions on the geographical zone’s security outfit, Operation Amotekun. The Chairman of the South-West Governors’ Forum, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, stated this on Tuesday in Abuja during a visit to the Presidential Villa. Akeredolu, who is the governor of Ondo State, held a meeting with the President Muhammadu Buhari. Recall that the states were asked to initiate bills to the legislatures in their respective jurisdictions to pass laws backing Amotekun. This came after the federal government approved the exercise, which is now expected to run side-by-side the government’s community policing concept. He spoke with State House Correspondents in a reaction to the speculation that his visit to Buhari was in connection with Amotekun. The governor clarified that his visit to invite the President to participate in the activities lined up for the third anniversary of his administration. He said the President was invited specifically to inaugurate the Ore-Benin interchange and the Ondo industrial hub. The governor also denied that he backed the Amotekun project to cash in on it to win re-election for a second term. The governor said, “Amotekun is about security and on the 6th of this month, the state governors (of the South-West) will meet with Inspector-General of Police to sort out a few things. “We don’t need Amotekun for the people of Ondo state to appreciate what we have done in the last three years.” He explained that the Ore-Benin interchange was so dear to the people of the state, who had long suffered along the route due to traffic challenges, a reason he wanted Buhari to inaugurate it. He disclosed that the state government spent “over N5bn” to complete the flyover.
