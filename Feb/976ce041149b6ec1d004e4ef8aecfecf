The Minister of Sports and Youth Development, Sunday Dare, has vowed that there would be severe consequences for teams that allow their supporters become violent during games. Dare’s statement is coming on the heels of the violence that rocked the Nigeria Professional Football League match between Abia Warriors and Enyimba at the Umuahia Township Stadium on Sunday, which left Enyimba chairman, Felix Anyansi-Agwu, and others injured. The minister, who spoke through his Twitter handle said, “The violence gradually engulfing the domestic league cannot go on unabated. There must be severe consequences for teams and their supporters to serve as deterrence. I will be meeting with the LMC shortly.” The Sunday match between Enyimba and Abia Warriors was called off by officials in the 24th minute as the angry mob refused to leave the pitch.
