The Osun State Council of Traditional Rulers has suspended the Oluwo of Iwoland, Oba Abdulrasheed Akanbi, for six months. Oba Akanbi was found guilty of assault by the committee set up by the council of Obas following his encounter with another Oba within Iwoland. A committee headed by Orangun of Ila, Oba Wahab Adedotun, was also constituted by the council to further investigate the matter involving Oluwo and Obas in Iwo land. The royal fathers at their emergency meeting held at Osun State Government Secretariat, Abere, presided over by Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, arrived at the decision to suspend Oba Akanbi.
