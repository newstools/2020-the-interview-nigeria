The national leader of Kwankwasiyya Movement and a former governor of Kano, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has sought the support of People’s Democratic Party national leadership for the review of Kano governorship election petition at the Supreme Court. Senator Kwankwaso alongside the PDP governorship candidate Engr. Abba K. Yusuf also known as ”Abba Gida” and other prominent PDP stakeholders from Kano State paid a solidarity visit to the national executive council in Abuja. A statement issued on Wednesday by Media Aide to Yusuf, Ibrahim Adam, said Kwankwaso appealed to the national working committee to, as a matter of responsibility, facilitate the process of the Supreme Court’s review on the Kano election petition. According to the statement, he lamented that Kano people were robbed their mandate through voter disenfranchisement and manipulation of judicial processes. The statement revealed that the national chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus, represented by his deputy, Senator Suleiman Nazif, said PDP had taken Kano as the major support base in northern Nigeria and will do everything within the confines of the law to protect the party’s interests in the state. It noted that Senator Nazif applauded Kwankwaso for his tenacity in leading the party to victory in the 2019 governorship election.
