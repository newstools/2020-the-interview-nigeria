BBC in a live update identified the player as Paul Akpan Udoh, who is an Italian-Nigerian footballer. Udon is a 22-year-old player, who plays for Pianese in Serie C. He was said to be diagnosed on Thursday and has been quarantined. A statement from the Tuscany region read, “Two new suspected positive cases of Coronavirus in Tuscany. Both are awaiting confirmation by the Higher Institute of Health. “One is a 22-year-old man in the Siena province, a Pianese player, who last Saturday had symptoms in a hotel in Alessandria, where he was training with the team ahead of Sunday’s game (at Juventus U-23s). “He did not play the game that morning as he had a high fever. The team returned to Piancastagnaio, while he went home. Wednesday morning, he was tested in his home and the results came back as positive in the evening. “Since early this morning, he is at a hospital in Siena, in isolation. He is in good, healthy condition. Another player of the team felt the same symptoms, which the club is tracking.” Credit: The Punch
