A former national publicity secretary of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Olisa Metuh, has been convicted for charges of fraud by a federal high court in the FCT. In seven-count charge brought against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Metuh was on Tuesday pronounced guilty by Justice Okon Abang for illegally receiving N400m from the former National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki. He was convicted alongside a company, Destra Investsment for breaching the Money Laundering Prohibitio Act. Justice Abang, in delivering the judgement, said he didn’t believe the former PDP spokesman was truthful to the court and and that the prosecution succeeded in proving at least one of the seven counts against Metuh. He said, “It is my firm view that as at November 24, 2014, the first defendant had actual knowledge of the inflow from ONSA in the account of the second defendant.”
