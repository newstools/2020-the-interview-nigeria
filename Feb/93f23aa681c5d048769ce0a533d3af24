The Minister of communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami, on Wednesday said he didn’t know about Value Added Tax (VAT) deductions on calls and text messages. A Twitter follower, Opeyemi Musab, had asked the minister if the VAT deductions on calls and text was normal. Responding to this question, however, Pantami said he had no input in the VAT deduction on texts and calls and that it was outside his mandate as minister of communications and digital economy. Pantami said, “This is completely outside my mandate. VAT has to do with Ministry of Finance and FIRS. I didn’t have input in it. I saw it the way you saw it, my brother”.
