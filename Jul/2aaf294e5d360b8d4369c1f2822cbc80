The Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali-Pantami, has called on the Nigeria Postal Service, NIPOST, to suspend implementation of its new license fees for the courier service companies. NIPOST had announced an increment in the fees charged for licensing national and international courier service companies to N10million and N20million respectively. This announcement sparked criticism from Nigerians on social media with #SayNoToNipostFee trending on Saturday. Pantami, in a tweet on Saturday, however ordered NIPOST to suspend the increment as it was not part of what he approved for the agency on Friday, July 24. “Pls @NipostNgn, our attention has been drawn to an increase of license fee, which was not part of the regulation I earlier APPROVED for you, he said. Pantami added that the chairman of NIPOST had been told to put the implementation of the new fees increment on hold. “Your Chair and PMG were YESTERDAY contacted to put the implementation on hold and send a report to our ministry by Monday. Best wishes!,” Pantami said.
