Boko Haram has posted a video on social media showing the execution from five humanitarian workers who were believed to have been kidnapped as far back as June 29, 2020 while on their way to Monguna, from Maiduguri, the Borno State capital. The video lasting just over half a minute showed masked men executing the aide workers after an unidentified voice of one the terrorists, speaking in in Hausa accused them of working with the infidels. The Boko Haram fighter said, “This is a strong message to those who are being used by unbelievers to convert people to infidels…those who are working for the organisations of disbelievers. “You work for them to achieve their goals but they do not care about you that is the reason when we abducted you, they showed no care. We are calling on you to repent and turn to God. “For those of you remaining, we will surely get you… we know the routes you follow. If you do not desist, you’ll end just like these people too.” The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has commenced the implementation of the Accounting Separation Framework (ASF) in the Nigerian telecoms industry effective from July 15, 2020. This, according to the Commission, is in order to further ensure transparency and accountability in regard to effective regulation and prevention of anti-competitive behaviour According to a statement by Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde,the agency’s director of public affairs, the policy document, “Determination on the Implementation of an Accounting Separation Framework for the Nigerian Telecoms Industry”, which was developed via a consultative process in 2015, has undergone a comprehensive review by the regulator in collaboration with telecoms licensees and other critical industry stakeholders.

Prof. Umar Danbatta, the Executive Vice Chairman of the NCC, Adinde said, expressed optimism about the framework noting that “the new ASF will promote an industry environment that fosters open and transparent financial reporting, while ensuring that charges for telecom services are cost-based and non-discriminatory.” The Commission, however stated that submission of RFS in line with the new framework, is currently limited to and mandatory for only six telecom licensees, adding that this will subsist for an initial period of two years after which the regulator may review the list to include other operators.

For full and effective implementation of the Framework, Adinde said, “every operator under the ambit of accounting separation is required to prepare an Operator-specific Accounting Separation Manual (OASM) containing policies, principles, methodologies and procedures for accounting and cost allocation, which must be submitted to the Commission on or before October 30, 2020 for regulatory approval.” He said, “Licensees shall also be required to prepare their financial and non-financial reports in line with the Guidelines for the ASF while reports shall be furnished by the licensees for every account year beginning from the 2020 financial year end. “Also, as part of operators’ licensing conditions, the Commission requires licensees to prepare, in respect of each complete financial year or of such lesser periods as may be specified, separated accounting statements for all their activities.

Danbatta further reiterated the commitment of the Commission towards continually developing policies, initiatives and programmes aimed at boosting healthy competition among telecoms operators in the country to ensure that consumers continue to enjoy efficient and affordable telecom services.
