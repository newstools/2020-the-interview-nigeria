President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday said that the revised 2020 budget would help the country to navigate through the difficult times caused by the raging COVID-19 pandemic. He stated that it was the pandemic that forced a review of the budget on government, having crashed crude oil prices from a high of $72.2 in January to under $20, before it rose gradually to around $40 per barrel lately. The President spoke in Abuja while signing into law, the Appropriation (Repeal and Amendment) Act, 2020, at the Presidential Villa. He explained that the re-worked N10.8trn budget would be implemented along with the recently approved N2.3tn stimulus programme to navigate the country through the pandemic.

The President stated that total capital releases for the year stood at N253.33bn as of May 31, adding that with the amendments, more funds would be made available for the execution of projects. Recall that the original size of the 2020 budget, pre-COVID-19 pandemic, was N10.59tn, with a crude oil benchmark of $57.
