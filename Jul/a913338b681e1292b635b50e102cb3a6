The American President Donald Trump on Thursday hinted that he would rather the forthcoming Presidential election be delayed than compromise Americans safety. The American election is scheduled to hold on November 3. Trump in a tweet on Thursday suggested that the  election scheduled to hold on November 3 be delayed until people could safely vote. He claimed that Mail-In voting option would make the 2020 election the most “inaccurate and fraudulent” in the history of America if adopted. “With Universal Mail-In-Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. “It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote?, Trump said. Trump is seeking  reelection against his major challenger, Democratic Party’s Joe Biden, who was vice president to Barack Obama.
