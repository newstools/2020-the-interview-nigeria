Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has overtaken President Donald Trump in the votes count in battleground state of Georgia by at least 917 votes. Both candidates have roughly 49.4 per cent of the votes, a margin which could lead to demand for a recount by the losing side. Trump’s Republican Party has already lost court cases trying to halt vote counts in states like Michigan  Pennsylvania and Georgia. The lead means Trump’s path to victory has effectively been cut off, with Biden more likely than ever to emerge as president-elect. Vote counting continues in at least five states including Georgia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. Trump needs to win at least four of those state and can only afford to lose the state of Nevada, which he did not win in 2016. He won all the other four states in 2016. Joe Biden on the other hand does not need to win Georgia to emerge victorious in the election.
