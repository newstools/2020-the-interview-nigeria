President Muhammadu Buhari has sent out a message of condolence to the people of Bauchi on the death of Ali Kwara, a vigilante leader and hunter famous for helping law enforcement track criminals. In a statement signed by Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Friday, the president expressed sorrow over the loss of Kwara. The statement by Shehu mentioned Kwara’s “movie-like exploits against bandits, armed robbers and terrorists are well documented in virtually all the 19 Northern states, died in Abuja where the government had brought him to take over his medical treatment.” Shehu said, “Last night, the Presidency made available a plane to take the corpse to Dutse Airport for its planned burial in his home town, Azare in Bauchi State.” The president said, “On behalf of the government and the people of the entire country, I condole with the people of Bauchi State and their government following the sad exit of this extraordinary citizen who devoted his entire life to assisting law enforcement officials in their fight against criminals.” According to him, “Ali Kwara will not be forgotten for roles he played in subduing hardened criminals and warlords in our forests. Thanks to his efforts, several of such criminals were lucky to be reformed while many more have been made to face justice. Few of such brave men are found in a generation. May Allah grant him Aljannah.”
