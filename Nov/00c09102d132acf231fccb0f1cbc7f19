On the eve of US presidential election, nearly 100 million Americans had already voted either by taking advantage of early voting as supported by some states or voting by mail to avoid in-person voting due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. In 2016, 139 millions people voted in the election. The numbers for 2020 suggest the number of voters will surpass 160 million. Americans are voting in one of the most divisive presidential elections in decades, pitting incumbent Republican Donald Trump against his Democratic challenger Joe Biden. The first polls opened from 05:00 EDT (10:00 GMT) in Vermont.

Both rivals spent the final hours of the race rallying in key swing states. National polls give a firm lead to Mr. Biden, but it is a closer race in the states that could decide the outcome. READ ALSO: Win or Lose, Trump Is A Danger To Africa As polling places were set to open on Election Day, Mr. Trump’s road back to the White House was plainly narrower than Mr. Biden’s pathway. Polls show Mr. Trump trailing nationally and in most of the key battlegrounds needed to reach the 270 electoral votes required to win the presidency. Most private and public polls in the United States of America are forecasting a victory for Democratic Party candidate in Tuesday’s presidential elections. While several newspapers are also forecasting victory for the former vice president over Republican Party candidate, President Donald Trump, one newspaper, Politico reported on the states it thinks will push Biden to victory. The latest from POLITICO’s 2020 Election Forecast has ratings from Senior Elections Editor Steve Shepard for the White House race: Democrat Joe Biden is the favorite entering Election Day. There is still a plausible path for President Donald Trump to win an Electoral College majority — but it is narrow Here’s a state-by-state guide to the latest polls at the end of the election in 13 of the 14 states rated either as “Toss Ups,” “Lean Republican” or “Lean Democratic” in POLITICO’s Election Forecast (minus Alaska, where there is little public polling): Arizona (11 electoral votes): FiveThirtyEight average as of Monday evening: Biden +2.6 FiveThirtyEight final 2016 “polls-only” forecast: Trump +2.4 2016 result: Trump +3.5 READ ALSO: 9 Nigerians Contesting In Tuesday’s US Elections Befitting its toss-up status, the final live-interview poll in Arizona, an NBC News/Marist poll released Monday, showed a tied race in Arizona, 48 percent to 48 percent. Biden does lead in the polling average, however, as other late surveys have given him the edge, including a 6-point lead in a New York Times/Siena College poll out on Sunday. Florida (29 electoral votes): FiveThirtyEight average: Biden +2.5 FiveThirtyEight final 2016 “polls-only” forecast: Clinton +0.6 2016 result: Trump +1.2 Biden enters the election about 2 points stronger than Clinton was in 2016, when Trump emerged with a 1-point victory. The final live-caller poll, from Quinnipiac University, showed Biden ahead by 5 points — though Quinnipiac overestimated Democrats in the state in the 2018 midterms. Georgia (16 electoral votes): FiveThirtyEight average: Biden +1 FiveThirtyEight final 2016 “polls-only” forecast: Trump +4 2016 result: Trump +5.1 Georgia has raced away from Trump in the polls: He led by 4 points on the eve of the 2016 election and won by 5 — the rare state where Trump didn’t overperform significantly on Election Day. He and Biden are neck-and-neck now, with the Democrat a point ahead in the FiveThirtyEight average.

That’s out of line with the average, which showed a closer race. But the Register’s final poll was also better for Trump than the average in 2016 — and it was right. Michigan (16 electoral votes): FiveThirtyEight average: Biden +8 FiveThirtyEight final 2016 “polls-only” forecast: Clinton +4.2 2016 result: Trump +0.2 Biden’s 8-point advantage in Michigan — the state Trump won by the narrowest margin in 2016 — is nearly twice Hillary Clinton’s pre-2016 lead. The live-interview polls in the final two weeks of the race gave Biden a lead between 7 and 12 points. They’d have to be way off for Trump to win there again. Minnesota (10 electoral votes): FiveThirtyEight average: Biden +9.4 FiveThirtyEight final 2016 “polls-only” forecast: Clinton +5.8 2016 result: Clinton +1.5 Trump’s narrow loss in Minnesota was an underrated surprise from 2016. But in order to make a real challenge there this year, he’d have to overcome a bigger Biden advantage of nearly 10 points.

That makes his current 5-point deficit appear more daunting. New Hampshire (4 electoral votes): FiveThirtyEight average: Biden +11.1 FiveThirtyEight final 2016 “polls-only” forecast: Clinton +3.6 2016 result: Clinton +0.4 Trump’s narrow 2016 loss in New Hampshire came after entering Election Day within 4 points in the polls. He’s down by at least twice that now: Two in-state academic pollsters showed Biden ahead by 8 points last week. North Carolina (15 electoral votes): FiveThirtyEight average: Biden +1.9 FiveThirtyEight final 2016 “polls-only” forecast: Clinton +0.7 2016 result: Trump +3.6 As in 2016, the polls are tight in North Carolina. There’s a slight gap between the live-interview polls — the final two, from CNN/SSRS and NBC News/Marist, showed Biden ahead by 6 points — and web surveys showing essentially a tied race. Trump out-ran his polls there in 2016, winning the state by almost 4 points. It was an early sign the night was breaking his way in a state where the polls close early (7:30 p.m. Eastern). Ohio (18 electoral votes): FiveThirtyEight average: Trump +0.7 FiveThirtyEight final 2016 “polls-only” forecast: Trump +1.9 2016 result: Trump +8.1 This is the only one of the 13 states in this analysis where Trump currently leads in the polling average — even after a Quinnipiac poll out on Monday gave Biden a 4-point advantage.

He’s ahead by around 5 points, just a little above Clinton’s nearly 4-point lead four years ago. Trump’s only leads are in surveys by two Republican pollsters, while the other surveys show Biden ahead — and, in a key difference from 2016, at or above 50 percent. That includes two surveys on Monday: an NBC News/Marist poll showing Biden ahead, 51 percent to 46 percent, and a Monmouth University poll showing similar numbers among its various turnout models.
