A former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Attahiru Jega, has described the late Alhaji Balarabe Musa, as “a corrupt-free leader” whose virtues are worthy of emulation. Jega made this known during his condolence visit to the family of the deceased in Kaduna on Thursday. Balarabe Musa was the first civilian Governor of the old Kaduna State. He said that the deceased was one of the most selfless politicians in the history of the country. “His history of radical politics and the devotion of his entire life addressing the needs and aspirations of the common man should serve as a good path for the young generations and politicians to emulate”, he said. Jega prayed God to forgive the deceased his shortcomings and give Nigerian politicians, especially the youth, the courage and determination to struggle toward advancing the interests of the common man. “Certainly, there is a lot we can learn from the shining qualities of late Balarabe Musa. “If we can rededicate our efforts to those values which he held in his life time, we will definitely go a long way in moving the country forward,” Jega said. He urged Nigerians and indigenes of Kaduna State in particular to continue to promote the good things he stood for while alive for the development of the country and the state. Mr. Ben Kure, the Special Adviser on Political Matters to Governor Nasir El-Rufai, described the late Balarabe Musa as “a father and an exemplary leader”. “He was a man of humility; very transparent, honest, truthful and he strived for the cause of the common man. “We pray for God Almighty to make the grave a resting abode for him”, Kure said. Pastor Yohanna Buru, the Founder of Peace Revival and Reconciliation Foundation of Nigeria, also described late Balarabe Musa as “a corrupt-free leader whose life was worthy of example’’. He prayed God to grant the deceased’s family the fortitude to bear the loss, urging Nigerians to live a simple and Godly life. (NAN)
