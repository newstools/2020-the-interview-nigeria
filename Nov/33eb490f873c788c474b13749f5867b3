Democratic Party candidate, Joe Biden, has won the US presidential election, defeating Republican President Donald with 284 electoral votes to 213 electoral votes. Two states, Georgia and Neveda are still undeclared, which could take the winner in to 306 electoral college votes. In a tweet after the results in Pennsylvania, with its 20 electoral votes, were called in his favour, Biden promised to be the president of all Americans. In the popular votes, Biden got 74.9 million votes to Trumpâ€™s 70.78 million votes. No winning candidate in history has scored even the 70.78 million votes Trump got. Former Vice President Joe Biden broke the record for the most number of votes cast for any presidential candidate in history by early Wednesday afternoon. The 74.915 votes Biden scored shatters a previous record for the most votes cast for a president set by Democrat Barack Obama in 2008, with nearly 69,500,000 votes, according to the Federal Election Commission. Votes for Biden represented 50.46 per cent of the total number of votes counted so far, with many more expected.
